Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.

Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.

Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?

I did.

Queen Harry?

Can we go now?

I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.

You did what?

After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --

What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?

Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.

It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?

I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.

Just sent 'em through.

I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.

You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?

He seems like he thrives on danger

Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.

No, I ' m not.

You get the girl.

But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?

You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?

What?

Does this conversation have a purpose?

I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.

Block E?

You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.

Who cares?

I didn't have a choice.

Who?

I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.

That's what you want, isn't it?

I just need to lie down for awhile

Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?

You know what they say

You 're so --

Maybe.

Go to the prom with me

Why not?

You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!

I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.

So what I want doesn't matter?

I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.

No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.

Yeah.  I guess.

Just for now.

Yeah.

I'm likin' you guys better

No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.

What's to discuss?

Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...

Dr. Ruth?

We'll all go crazy...

I am, Your Eminence

Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...

I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!

Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...

Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.

I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.

Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!

There must be a passage to that other ocean.

What...?  Do I have so many already?

Look out of that window.

Thousands.

Chief says -- he has a God.

He understands.

That's what it says.

Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.

I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!

Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?

Damn God!

If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...

Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.

If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.

Savagery is what monkeys understand.

The land is there.  I know it!

Yes, Your Majesty.

Is this true, Brother Buyl?

No, he is here.  Shit...

What's your cut?  How much?

Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.

Give me another one, please.

My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.

Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.

Can I see your back?

Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.

No.

So you were never a prostitute?

I know.

Right.

I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!

What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'

But Chief?  Over this??

Yeah, right.

Yeah.

Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.

Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.

What are you saying?

This has nothing to do with your fire.

This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.

Of course.

I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.

She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.

My point exactly.

Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.

How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.

Then do it, asshole.

We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.

I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.

I really can't give out any information right now at this point.

Alright?

Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...

You're ruthless.

Could be Leon's.

Answer the phone.

That's good.

No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.

Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.

Tonight.

No.  Are you proposing?

Get down on your knees.

Where is escort service?

Yes sir.

Is there a problem?

I want to document my trip to America.

I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?

Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?

Cut!

Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.

Credit?

Milos.  Get my money!

A job?

Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.

Alright.  Go ahead.

Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?

Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?

Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!

I used an accelerant.

It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!

Not good.

...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?

Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.

Yes, I don't know what to make of it.

I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.

I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.

Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.

And don't you worry about it.

The antenna has to be replaced.

Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.

Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.

Still, you really don't believe it, do you?

No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.

I'll bet it's a fortune.

How is gregor?

Well, that does sound very odd.

Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.

Please, it really doesn't matter.

Yes, very pleasant.

Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?

Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?

There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.

I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.

True.

Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?

Roger.

Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.

I want to pick up my car.

Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.

You got a real big mouth, convict.

Yeah, dummy.  Money.

Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...

Goodbye.

Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.

No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...

Here's hoping, baby...

I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.

I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.

Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...

It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.

Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.

Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.

Last night, two nights ago, three?

You have a good time?

At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?

It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.

Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.

While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.

...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.

I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.

Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.

Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.

If they don't tell me what I need to know...

If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.

What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.

What about Ganz?

Luther's on the move...

Yeah. It missed the last four stops.

And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?

You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.

You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.

I lost them, that's what happened.

They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.

Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.

Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.

They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.

Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?

What?

When? How?

You're hopeless.

I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.

You sure you want me to?

I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...

Yeah, one of my favorites.

I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.

No, it's I'm just surprised you called.

Jack, wait...

Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.

Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.

That's what I always say.

Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.

What do you want?

Sure, right.

Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-

Not bad, not bad.

It's loaded... I got some shells in here.

This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...

Five bills.

Corn-i-Lius?

You know exactly where they are!

I'm fucked!

Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.

What kind of mission?

Good luck..

Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.

Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.

Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!

One more reason to shoot first eh?

And then?

Yes..thank God..

This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.

I didn't know your size.

Perfect.

Don't exist bud.

In your dreams! See you tonight!

...Leeloo.

You little sleaze bag!

Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!

I had the worst goddamn nightmare.

This is a police control action..

Found it?

Yeah, very big, a giant.

I've had enough good news for today

Old tricks are the best tricks eh?

You know women normally change five times more than men.

OK, you can turn around!

Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?

Exactly.

I love you...

The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.

Actually only one cell survived..

It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.

Yes... I can't wait to meet him.

How much time is left?

Perfect, Mr. President.

I'm about to, Mr. President.

Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?

Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.

Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.

I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?

... What's going on?

I wanted to call.  I couldn't.

Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.

I just talked to her.

There's nothing harder.

The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...

Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?

Machine.

Move it, dirtbag... !

First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...

Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...

Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?

We do.

I'm not so sure about this.

I don't know...

Something like that.

Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!

You enjoy it?

Nobody saw you bring her in?

Show me.

Where?  Show me where.

I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?

Never mind how I found you.

None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.

I'm asking.

Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.

Good for you.

Max.

There's not much illegal.

You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.

Four hundred a week, off the books.

Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.

Interesting theory.

Snuff films.

I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?

I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?

A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?

It's their Presidential Suite.

I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.

I try to be.

I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.

You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.

I'm afraid I don't...

I'm telling you it's not that.

I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.

I don't understand, who are... ?

She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.

I don't know.

There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...

You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.

No.  You don't have any reason to think that...

Yes.

No... no... no...

You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...

I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.

None too discreet, is he?

But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.

What?

I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...

Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?

When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.

I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.

Why can't we just talk to the authorities?

Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.

Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!

Avoid-all-contact-day.

When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.

You're not taking my baby!

Jesus!  Don't do that!

Yeah...I guess.

Sobering...

But Dad --

There aren't any little boys on your floor.

Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.

If they actually bothered to bury her.

So did Dan.

She must've fallen asleep at the table...

It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.

I don't know!

Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.

Who?

Yeah...

I want to talk about the baby.

I can't listen to this.

He invited me to his house last night.

Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!

Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.

But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!

<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?

A lot of people think like that.

Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?

We'll have to look for them later.

Oh it does???

Seems to be all around...

I...don't know!

What???

Something wrong?

Why do you say that?

Anything ---

<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....

Who with?

We can <u>ram</u> him!

It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.

This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.

Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.

Has anybody offered to buy it?

Twombley involved?

He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.

Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.

Tell me.

Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.

Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?

You can't buy Wade off.

You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.

You played for the Sox?

Oh.

Sun's gettin high.

You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.

Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 

Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?

Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.

Shit.

A half mile in, along the old lumber road.

Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?

Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.

What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.

He sure as hell won't.

Lawford?

I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.

Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.

I guess they're stupid.

I don't want to.

I want to go home.  I don't like it here.

Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.

Nothing.

I know.

I'm not saying that.

Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.

You mean Twombley?

I'm fine, fine.

You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?

Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.

Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.

Where's Jill?

No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.

I know who it is.

Mel Gordon.

From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.

For a while.

I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.

Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?

The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?

You knew me as a kid.

I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.

I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.

Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.

It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.

When did she die?

How's that?

Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.

Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.

What?

This town sucks.

Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.

Sleeping.

From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?

I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.

Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.

You think you can take me now? Come on, try.

Wade?

Twombley.

Want to know what I think happened?

Money.

Yeah.

You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?

Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.

I'm sure he's busy.

Some kids were teasing you?

Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.

Jim... for godsake!

So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.

Hey, you guys back already?

Alice... I...

Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.

Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.

This doesn't make sense.

An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.

Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.

Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.

Dead.

Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.

Copy, Air Force One.

The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.

Thank you.

Maria... Maria Mitchell.

How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?

Come on, Alice.

Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...

You will be the first to pay for that mistake.

You'll do it?

Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!

Hold on, Alice.

You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.

Gravity.

Can't it wait?

Rose, I don't have time for this.

And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?

Flying the plane.

Excuse me?

Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?

This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.

Commissioner.

That just doesn't make any sense.

Commissioner, Aquarius.

I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!

Not now, Elaine!

We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.

Ted, there's no time to explain.

Not now, Elaine.

The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.

The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...

And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.

But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.

Simon, why has he become so... so...

Roger.

Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?

Maybe.

Negative.

Go ahead.

Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...

I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.

Yeah.

I don't want to hear that word!

You're sure?

Sixteen 'C', why?

Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.

Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.

Do you have an appointment, sir?

Pull yourself together!  We've got to...

Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?

I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.

We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.

I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.

No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.

I can't tell.

I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.

A hospital? What is it?

I just don't want to go over it any more.

I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.

But if you'll just give me...

Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.

Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.

I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.

Uh-huh.

Hello.

Who wants to be first?

Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.

I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?

I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.

Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?

Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?

No, why don't you take care ot it?

All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.

Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.

Thank you.

No. No thank you.

Does that cost extra or you throw them in?

The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.

Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.

Yeah...

Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.

I am George.

His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.

There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.

Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?

So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.

Aw-right.  What about the other guy?

Uh, Matthew...

But I-- .

Screw me?  That can't be right.

Your mother mates out of season.

Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.

Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.

My wife?  She worries about me.

Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.

Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.

We all did.

Fuck procedure.

Only holds five.

No... two.

Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.

Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.

Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.

You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.

Departmental policy.

Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...

Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!

Position?

Talk to me, Hudson.

I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.

You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?

Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.

I heard you were working in the cargo docks.

What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?

Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.

Corporal Hicks!?

You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.

We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.

Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.

They're but off!  Do something!

...We're coming in.

Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.

Alive?

Fuckin' A!

We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.

Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.

No.  Have you?

You're just reading me.

The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --

Think of what?  We're fucked.

They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?

Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'

Terrible.

How long have I been on Gateway station?

And hope to die?

I don't want to...I have scary dreams.

Why do they tell little kids that?

Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?

Did you ever have a baby?

Where is she?

Yes, honey.  I think we both can.

It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.

Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.

Good morning.

Yes.

A Turkish brothel.

You might be disappointed.

What?

Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.

I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.

Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?

Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.

No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!

No, this is serious. Say it backwards.

Ui-vol-i-tub!

They'll come anyway. They love me here.

Don't be stupid.

Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.

Tell them to go!

Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?

What? How can you be so boring? Tea!

Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.

I can't write it!

What do you mean?

But! I'm a married woman!

I was at hand.

He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.

You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!

Oh, yes.

I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.

Gertrude!

Who was your teacher?

You do me too much honour, Sire.

Your Highness.

Yes?

And the result satisfies.

It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.

Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.

Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.

Well, yes, I admit it is.

Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.

Ah, love again.

You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.

I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.

He's here.

How is your financial situation?

That's not what I hear.

How many pupils do you have?

Oh, let's not talk about it.

Papa!

Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'

Good morning, sir.

Really? What is it he's writing?

Yes what?

I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.

Are you Herr Mozart?

Sublime! Utterly sublime!

Yes, well, it's all good fun.

No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.

Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?

But this is absurd!

Did you like it, then?

Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!

It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.

Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.

I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?

Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.

I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.

Do you mean that?

I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.

I'm too young to be so sick.

Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?

My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.

Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?

The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.

What?

We ended in F Major?

What time?

Also identical?

I think so.

Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.

I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?

Just let me tell you how it begins.

Certainly, Herr Director.

Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!

Mozart -

May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?

In the sight of God that is a sin.

That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.

My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.

Ah - you've heard that?

He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.

My son, no one can speak for God.

Never mind.

Well done, Sire!

Did we?

Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.

Show her in. Then go to bed.

Yes, I am looking after him.

Dr. Hirsch?

Yes, I believe he did.

Come to my office, Miss Price.

At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...

Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?

What did he say?

Warn him?

I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.

No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.

David?

Leave the pills. I'll take them later.

Will you give me a break?

Shall I read to you?

Now I'm embarrassed.

What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?

Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.

A doper werewolf.

I'm freezing.

Pull over.

Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!

I swear, I don't know this girl.

Will you shut up!?!!

No.

No.

You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.

You could have told them!

The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?

Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?

So they said.

In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.

Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?

She's a jerk.

I don't know.

It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.

You ask them.

I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.

I have no idea.

I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.

I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.

I don't know. Come on.

Walk away, Jack.

Not far enough. Come on.

On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.

You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.

You must believe me.

You don't have to say anything.

If I was still alive, I probably would.

Roger Mathison, Doctor.

I suppose Guinness will suffice.

I beg your pardon?

Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?

And what, Sergeant?

You here again? What do you want?

Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?

I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.

No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.

Matt?

Yes, sir.

I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.

Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?

Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!

Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.

She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.

Get out, get out!

I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!

Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!

Why, I needed a

Well, you can. You always could.

What is?

Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?

Well

Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.

What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?

Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.

This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?

Tomorrow night?

Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?

Yes, sir.

Numbers? No, never mind.

Good morning.

Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?

There you are.

You're protecting somebody.

Were you in Cluett's apartment?

Was Mrs. Dickson there?

Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?

But I haven't . . .

If he can do it, yes.

Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.

All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.

Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?

A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?

All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.

Yeah, swell.

Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.

Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.

Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that

All right, dear.

Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.

I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.

He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.

Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.

It couldn't have been earlier?

There you are!

Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.

It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.

Leave me alone, Bob.

Swear on Jimmy's grave.

He's not bad at it.

Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!

Nope.

Hey!

You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!

Tell me.

She got two of them.

After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?

Perfect, Cole.

I got three.

It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.

Sure, cousin.

If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.

Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --

That's it.

Who's next? You? Me? Bob?

Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.

We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.

Get buckets!

Of course!  Uh, sir?

On account of we're robbing it.

So?

I had you covered.  From back there.

I think he's already feeling better.

I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.

Ma.

Don't care.

If I could go back to farming --

Maybe it started out that way. But now...

Oh yeah.

Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.

I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.

See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.

I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.

They're making him a hero now.

We're just fine, thank you, sir.

We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.

If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.

Mmmm.

Sparkling rocks?

When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.

Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!

She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.

"Hmm" what?

Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?

Stop it. This is just sad.

What?

I'll explain on the way.

Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.

I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.

You don't think God'll mind, do you?

I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...

It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?

Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.

Really?

I'm doing you folks a favor --

They had to be dealt with!

And it is my pleasure to be here.

Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.

Yes sir.

I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.

THEN WHO DID?!

I look forward to seeing it.

I remember you.

I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!

So you can't tell me anything?

Can you put men at all four?

I'm thinking Dorsia.

Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?

Is that Donald Trump's car?

You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.

Yes.

Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.

I'm ignoring you.

Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.

Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.

You and...Luis?

I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.

Is your Evian spiked?

Everybody's rich.

No. I'm not. Why should I ?

It's not.

Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?

We never really shared one.

I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.

Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?

Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.

It's just not.

No, you...didn't?

Commes des Garcon.

New card. What do you think?

But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

Ask me a question.

Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?

Just...say...no.

No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?

Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.

Oh no. I have no plans.

Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.

No, come on. Anywhere you want.

Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?

Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?

Growing. I'm glad you said that.

Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?

Jean-I'm not-

What are I doing?

Hello 

Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.

Paul Owen.

Does he do this all the time?

Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.

Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.

No, I'm okay.

Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-

The disappearance of Paul Owen.

No, really. I'm okay.

Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.

Harvard. The Harvard Business School.

Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.

No problem. 

No. Not really.

Oh.

No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.

It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...

0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?

Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.

God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.

Marcus?

I checked it out. It's clean.

Where was Marcus?

I'm not...

I'm hungry

Al.

You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.

I can't...I can't find a shelter

I've been great. And you?

Oh well, you know.

We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.

Yes, Owen?

Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.

Then you've gotta ask him about that.

No way. You have this -- destiny.

Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?

We're not gonna let it.

I know, I know.

Isn't that -- extreme?

It was a hate crime.

I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.

Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --

Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?

...Whaddo I do?

Guilt?

Poor baby. You know that's not true.

Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.

I am. I am, sir.

I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.

'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.

You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.

Wanna be a part of history?

He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?

Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?

We tried!

I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.

Maybe I'm going too fast.

Well -- you sent for me.

...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.

I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.

There may be a little less trust after your outburst.

Just do it.

In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.

Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?

Any irregularity in the pattern.

Let's get him in here.

I'm calling Gary.

No. Please.

Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?

What about "60 Minutes."

What?

But they'd still get the idea, right?

And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.

Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!

What?

Wait a second. He knows I know.

What?!

She's a programmer?

I've got a girlfriend, remember?

Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.

I could get it out of him.

Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.

Or sometimes not at all.

Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.

You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.

The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.

Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.

Thank you, Exposition.

Yes?

Thank you, Exposition.

Yes?

Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.

What's the other?

That's not your mother, that's a man!

I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.

I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.

Good on ya, man.

Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.

No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.

I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...

Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.

Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'

No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...

I couldn't have another bite.

I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.

I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.

Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.

Do you think she's prettier than I?

Indeed.

Yes.

That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.

I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.

My son?

Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!

Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.

Not me.

No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.

But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?

Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.

I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.

Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

Great.

You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.

Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.

... head ...

... love...

So I'm still ...

Have we met?

Eh? In here!

If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.

Hmmm ...

Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.

Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.

The Institute ... the funding ...

Quite frankly ... it could have been you.

So am I.

But I found you. All the clues led me here ...

You're mad.

I'll never marry you.

Rules are made to be broken.

And just what is the game?

Mother?

A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?

As per mother's instructions.

An eccentric recluse?

Small talk.  Try the weather.

Did he say who?

I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.

Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?

Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.

Nothing personal.

No trouble.

You lied.

Why's he called 'Invisible'?

Where are you going?

'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'

Still a bit chilly ...

I see.

I know all this.

Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.

Getting to what?

I fail to see --

Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...

Possibly. Split personality ...

Where?

I feel sure of it.

This way ...

Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...

Stay by the window. By the window.

Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.

Debbie's marrying Rick.

Chulo, one thing at a time.

Hey, man, congratulations!

Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.

What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?

When do the girls get to the party?

You dump her and I'll give you cash.

Not interested.

I'm marrying Debbie.

Ooh, be still, my heart.

So does Debbie.

Fan out and look for them.

Yes I did.

Thank you, sir.

What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.

Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?

You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...

Cole, I'm sorry, I...

I'm going now, Cole.

What's the matter?

About what?

Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.

How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.

Yeah.

You know your father enjoys his company.

My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.

What are you...

Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.

All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.

Rick, I really think I'm in love.

I want women.

Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.

No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.

I'm trying to slash my wrists.

Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...

You can tell a man by his friends.

Of course.

I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.

If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.

I don't know.

Take care.

Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?

I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.

You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.

We're gonna be okay, man...

-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.

He's alive.

Just come down, John. Just --

Thanks for the speakers.

You got a problem with drilling, probie?

I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.

What are we going to do about this?

We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.

Shut up!

I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.

So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.

Well, you did invite me here.

Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.

Then why did you quit?

-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --

You could check. It'd be in his files.

I quit two days ago, Brian.

I don't have the slightest idea...

It's a small town.

Hey, do I know you?

Then who --

-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.

Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.

Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.

What are you listening to?

No it couldn't.

What?

Son of a bitch. They knew each other.

No.

I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...

Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.

Four months.

No need to be modest, Brian.

Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.

Nice boat.

Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.

Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.

There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.

Coffee sucked.

Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.

Here we go...

He's out.

In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...

Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.

And the world -- the whole world.

Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.

I need that report, Lt.

Alderman.

You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?

OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?

Yes.

Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.

Me?

Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.

Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!

Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!

Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --

What case?

Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.

Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --

I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.

Give me some?

Delacroix.

What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.

I'm a revolutionary.

Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.

Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.

Sloan never told us she had friends like you.

Damn skippy.

Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.

And I'm the feet.

We're starving.

DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.

Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.

Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.

Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.

I'm sorry I'm late.

I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...

I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.

I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.

I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.

Go on.  Good so far.

Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.

So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.

Dunwitty, don't leave.

They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.

Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.

It's been a long time.

Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.

Nuthin' I can't handle.

Always keep 'em laughing.

I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.

Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?

What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?

Manray!

Good.  I'm going to need your support.

This is Cheeba.

Hello.

I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.

The pleasure is mine.

A gift.

It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.

Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.

Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.

It looks delicious.

Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.

I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?

I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.

He said that?

It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.

C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.

I just turned twenty.

Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.

You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?

What's a Negro.

First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.

I'm more comfortable around my people.

Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.

Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...

...I heard different, thought that was...

...too early...

You slept too near where you got in?

Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?

Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.

Gots no intention of ending up broke.

I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.

Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.

Just ask me what you want to know.

Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?

If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.

It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.

Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...

And his baggage?

It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.

Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.

Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!

I will let down the steps for your honor.

No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.

Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.

On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.

That is a trifle strong.

It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.

I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.

Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.

Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.

Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.

Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.

Agreed.

Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.

Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.

As much as possible.

It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.

In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.

What is to be done?

Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."

O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.

That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.

You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.

Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.

Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?

I see.

Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.

Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.

Would you have me spend my life all alone?

I'm -- I'm sorry...

I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.

We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!

We don't know. West is dead.

We found him like this...

We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.

This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.

That son of a bitch.

Did Kendall tell you about the PX?

Yeah --

Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.

You wanna bet?

Jesus!

The creek bed --

We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --

Sir, yes, sir!

I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?

You hated West more than any of us.

That's exactly what he says about you.

You're lying --

No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --

But not the only victim, right?

I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.

Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.

My heart weeps.

I don't know --

And the problem is you only got three.

I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.

Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.

I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.

I'm not even going to dignify that --

Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.

Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --

Yes.

Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.

I plan to grow on you.

What point?

Being back here. Gives me the willies.

I lied. Wait for it...

Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --

Watch me.

And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.

What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.

Good idea.

Get in.

Seven.

Really.

Think it'll work?

Want company?

I should probably write that down.

You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?

Poor fucker my ass...

What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.

He whispered it in my ear.

Because he'd shot Mueller.

Fifty minutes.

It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!

What the fuck are you doing?

Bullshit --

Shut up!

He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.

He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.

He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.

Sir, yes, sir!

Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.

There's only one I want.

Thank you.

It truly is.

Fine, I will.

No.

What did she look like?

I can get it. I can just...

Please. Go. Just go.

I know.

Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.

You were talking about your wedding.

Really?

I can.

Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?

Am I?

Did you do any of that?

You think I'm up for it?

So how does it happen?

Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.

Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.

Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...

I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.

I have the rest of my life to find out.

I'm robbing this place.

My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.

No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.

We'll have to pick up a copy.

I'll help you.

I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.

We rented a car.

He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.

Yes.

Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.

But I understand you, Mom. I always have.

The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.

What do you mean?

Do you want to stop?

No I haven't.

We better watch him. He's crazy.

So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.

Oh nothing.

Yes.

Yes.

Happy bath day.

I know you just want to punish me --

What? No you're not..

Have you got your passport?

Shut up. Have you got your passport?

I said I don't have any.

And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.

Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.

Sometimes.

Sometimes neither.

Why?

You don't have to say anything

What?

She's dead.

Laugh it up.

I'm trying to quit.

Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?

No. I think I better just go.

I'm sorry.

Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.

Yes?

You didn't have to do this.

Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.

Well. Hope you enjoy it.

You gonna sing me somethin'?

You seen my snake-skin shoes?

These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.

You gonna miss your bus.

They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.

You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?

Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?

Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?

And you gonna live it with him?

If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...

Let go of my arm...

BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.

Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!

How long... how long I been out?

I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...

Whose doin' is that?

Hm-mm... Hm-mm...

I CAN'T!

Let go of me...

Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...

No joke.

I'm here with you.

No one's gonna hurt you no more.

Word wit'cha. In private.

Now, hold up.

What'chu sayin'?

Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.

Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.

THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?

We ain't here to talk about that shit.

That's right.

You could put it that way.

Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.

Rae don't do this now...

You feelin' sick?

Are you wasted?

Yeah, I do.

Ronnie...

You need money again?

You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'

Get rid of it.

-- I should tear your head off.

Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?

What?

Beats forty hours on a plane.

Go to sleep, Charlie.

I didn't know.

Let's grab some food.

I'd feel better if we had some heat.

I don't think he'd feel it.

What's the problem here?

He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.

Shut-up.

He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.

No.

I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.

Why's that?

There was a change in plans.

I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.

Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.

Who am I supposed to be?

Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.

Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.

Then take it from him.

This by this...

Why?

He killed a police officer.

Right.

It is not allowed.

Why don't you ask your chief detective?

The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.

Twenty-four hours, detective.

If anything happens to her while I'm here --

I have to get to Sugai.

The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.

Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.

Not to be trapped.

I am?

Like what?

You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?

I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.

Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.

I know all that.

Shot of vodka, please.

Sorry, don't have the time.

Ya.

These aren't just...

Yeah?

Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.

Never been more sure of anything in my life.

Too old.

The girl that doesn't look like that girl.

Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.

I don't know nothing about it.

Sorry.

You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.

Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?

I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.

I work alone.

So?

What do you want me to do?

If they are smart, they take naps.

Yeah.

What?

Don't be fooled by appearances.

What's a long time?

No, I don't.

You know where I been.  I been on vacation.

No.

Thirteen.

Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.

Five, maybe six.

Don't move.

A tortoise.  What's that?

I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?

Is that why you're still here?

Yes, ma'am.

Do ya?

Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.

Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.

Why doesn't that surprise me?

Yes.

Perry?

Okay, okay!  Take it easy!

Oh, I could die...

Take it. damn it!

Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!

Can't you please just talk to me for one second?

No.

Hey, no kidding?  In color?

How long would you need me?

What's the pay?

Sure.

Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!

Hey, you know. I was thinking...

You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!

The big one!

Sure.

Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.

Everybody's divorced.

I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?

Two weeks.

You said it would be easy!

Is this your house?

Um-hum.

He's gone to check your answers on his computer.

Uh...yeah.

Yeah.

Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"

No way.

Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?

Okay. All right.  And what do I say?

Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.

What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!

Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!

Thanks.

Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.

And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!

Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!

Yes.

Tempus fugit!

Gerade aus dann links!

It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.

It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.

No, son. A pitcher.

No. Sit down.

Yes, father?! Yes?

Yes, sir.  Is that all?

I promise. Is that all?

I'll try.

Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.

I've never met anyone like you in my life.

1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.

Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?

I'm not wearing his pants.

I LOVE THIS!!

Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.

I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.

Goodbye.

Bye, Adam!

Of what?

I guess living up here makes people look older.

Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.

Oh, you got a problem with that?

Yes, ma'am.

Yes, ma'am.

No, wait! At least stay for dinner!

He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.

Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.

What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!

We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?

To you maybe.

To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.

How could you?! This is just like home!

Would you like a tranquilizer?

Mutants?!

I don't believe it!

Well, I am the head of this household--

--do as I say!

Yes, dear, I know.

Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?

Oh, my God...

You're goddamn right I am!

Give it back to him.

He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?

You didn't stop anywhere else?!

Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.

Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?

The criminals are winning.

Blue. It's Blue Velvet.

Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.

I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.

Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?

Yeah.

Nobody.

You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.

Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

It's okay. It's okay.

No, please. I won't.

You don't?

Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.

Yeah, hurry up though.

No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?

Don? Are you in with them?

Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.

Frank is coming?

Sure I do.

Beeeee careful.

What if Frank came over here and found us?

If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.

No.  Hi baby.

Who, Dorothy?

Alright, suit yourself.

Oh he forced you, huh?

Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.

What?

Nothing.

Okay Frank.

For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.

This is it.

I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.

Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?

I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.

I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.

Hey Jeff.

That's too bad.

Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.

I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.

I'm here, aren't I?

Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.

Alright. Good luck, yourself.

Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?

Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.

I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.

Oh, okay, can I call?

Are you sure?

Yeah. I mean a little, you know.

That's what I thought.

Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.

You better not, Jeffrey.

I'm really sorry.

I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.

Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.

Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.

Where to?

I like that idea, that's a real good idea.

Okay.

Go ahead!

No Jeffrey!!

Yeah, nice meetin' you.

Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.

Okay.

Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.

Go find one.

Yes mother.

Aye.

Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.

Got it.

Get a hold of yourself, man.

Yes.

Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.

Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?

He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?

Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.

This place is like a scumbag yard sale.

This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.

What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?

Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.

Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?

We... met them last night.

Be careful.

Ass!

Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?

A bit.

Yes, we are.

Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?

Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.

I'm strangely comfortable with it.

So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?

We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.

Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.

No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.

How do you figure?

Twist of lemon!

Sweet-n-low!

Shit! Shit!

Witness?

Who were the victims?

Hey Murph.

This is some crazy shit, man!

You sure you killed them?

Y'know it is, a bit.

Well, what'ya do?

Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...

Well, I'm sold.

What the fuck do you mean?

You feel?

Then you must find out what your beliefs are.

Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?

Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.

Yes.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.

What do you want me to say?

Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.

Fuck you Vincenzo.

Right. The blond guy.

But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?

Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.

That sets it off.

Nothing. Go ahead.

Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.

Like he would find Dignan. One day.

He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.

I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.

They obviously weren't designed for racing.

Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.

I know. But once you get inside you're home free.

Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.

No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.

Yes... It's true.

Well, I didn't do it, did I?

If you say so.

I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.

I don't know, Dignan. I just --

Shh.

Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.

You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --

How much?

She needed it.

Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.

Right. Freezers. Imported foods.

Right now.

Get out of the way.

Easy, Dignan. It's OK.

What the fuck are we doing out here?

I did.

Did that hurt?

I don't think you will.

Take your second position.

Any activity?

Stand by, Bird Dog.

Careful. Check his pulse.

Let's go. Come on.

I'll see you there.

Yes, there is. Let's get organized.

We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.

We're not sure.

It belongs to Bob's uncle.

We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.

What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.

You're kidding.

Scale the --

Thanks.

It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.

Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?

I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --

It feels good.

Me?

Death.

No. Bob did.

Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?

Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?

Who?

I don't know. Sure, I guess.

What was that?

OK, Dad.

You think I'm improving?

Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.

Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.

Why do you say that?

Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.

Sure.

Who's got the car keys?

God, yes. Like silk.

That's your friend Anthony?

So who's going to know?

You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.

You're paranoid, Bob.

Let's just go.

I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.

He electrocuted someone?

I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.

I told you they were there.

Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.

I can't do that, Bob.

What is it?

I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --

Man, I don't want to go into this.

I never agreed to that.

I know it, man. Hang on.

Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?

I think so.

Where's Applejack?

Here we go.

Social issues. Crime prevention.

Yes.

Where's that guy going?

No. I just have short hair.

Got a little lucky.

Fight. You know.

You Hoto?

Mr. Henry?

It's locked.

Good to know you, John.

Pleasure to meet you, John.

Will it track back to us?

With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.

What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.

I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.

We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.

Don't you want answers?

I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.

'Why' would be enough for me.

And Danny Zorn, what was that?

What do you have, Danny?

I speak English.

It's nothing. It's just a picture.

I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.

But it ends up the same.

The Telegraph office.

Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --

What?

-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --

What if it's not who you think it is?

Tell me later.

What is this, a game?

I killed him???

I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.

He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...

No. You never worked Berlin.

Your first assignment was Geneva.

Bourne?

I want someone I know to take me in.

Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.

-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --

I want to look at the room.  Check it out.

What? The tapes?

Me? Four years.

Yes, sir -- ma'am...

Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --

I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.

And why is that?

My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.

We cannot defeat this --

It is suicide.

My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.

He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.

That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.

You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.

You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.

Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.

You fancy him.

Fourteen? --

Aye.

Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.

I wanna have supper waitin'.

That depends on the man.

I will not.

No. He did not.

He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.

This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.

It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.

I... accept your proposal!

You scare me.

Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.

My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!

He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.

...I wouldn't know.

The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.

Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?

A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.

And the bad news?

But you must have something to go on?

The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.

When did you ever care about getting to school on time?

Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.

My father has a bad memory, too?

Honey. What were you doing with that?

Okay.

Something must've happened! What set him off?

How long will I be in here?

Cute, Evan.

Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.

You know my father?

No, protecting her.

Are you sure? Not even with my father?

My journals! Where are they?

I thought you were a December baby.

What the fuck are you doing?

Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!

You really don't remember anything that happened?

I'm sorry.

I've stopped a hundred times.

Wow. That must've taken some courage.

Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?

Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.

Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.

You'll see.

Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.

What do you mean?

I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.

Different? How?

Yeah?

I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.

Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?

Which is?

That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.

When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.

It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.

Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.

Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.

Evan Treborn.

Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?

Y... yes. I guess I did.

Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.

Fat little baby, crying for mommy.

What happened?? Where are we?!

It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.

Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.

I think I'll go check out the chapel.

I come from a big family.

Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.

Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.

Yes?

I came with Captain Renault.

No.

I thought so. Where's your husband?

Thank you, but I hardly think --

Yes, Monsieur.

Well, I'll get it from the safe.

-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.

Er, my check, please.

It's not for sale.

It's not for sale at any price.

Practically no one.

Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.

It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.

Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.

Good day.

This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.

In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.

I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."

It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.

Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?

Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.

No. No, Rick. Not tonight.

Has it got a wow finish?

Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.

Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?

You can believe that if you want to.

The stairs from the street.

It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.

-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.

I don't have to. I've got them right here.

Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?

I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.

She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.

I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.

Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.

Apparently he has the letters.

He suggested I ask you.

Sam?

He came from Paris with Rick.

Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?

What for?

Good evening. You see, here we are again.

I said, ask your wife.

Yes, rather.

Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.

All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.

No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.

No. Two champagne cocktails, please.

I slept very well.

May we proceed with the business?

I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.

Are you quite finished with us?

Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.

Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.

It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.

I see what you mean.

Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.

Yeah? Have a brandy?

It'll be interesting to see how he manages.

His escape.

-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.

Why two?

Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.

I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.

Well, it looks like you're a little late.

Huh?

It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.

That's so long ago, I don't remember.

Put that phone down!

Well, what makes you think I haven't?

-- You thought what?

Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?

I like it fine here.

You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.

Feels so good to lie here.

Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.

Do too much, I'll die.

Going to die anyway.

You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.

Fix raft first.

Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.

No!

I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.

I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.

You are.

They're harder to do than they look.

He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.

I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.

Let's take a look.

Cold.

Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?

Let me guess, Russia came up?

You can't go now.

You want to.

We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.

I can't take him to work.

I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.

A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?

Hey...hey...it's okay!

A few things came up.  Or went down.

You have any children?

Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.

My epitaph.

Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.

I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.

Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.

And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.

Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.

You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.

Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.

Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --

The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.

Borrowed.  I borrowed it.

Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.

It was fifteen minutes late.

You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.

Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.

Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.

You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!

Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.

No sweat.

You weren't dreaming about me.

It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.

Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!

We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?

Dr. Homer Wells.

He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.

She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...

They'll believe it because they want to believe it.

If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.

It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.

Sure... I'll see you around.

She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.

Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?

It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.

I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.

Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?

Right.

You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!

Please don't...

You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!

I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.

Yes, I *have*!

I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.

I know what you've been doing.

*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?

Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!

Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?

He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.

She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.

I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.

No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.

Have you enlisted?

Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?

I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.

Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.

Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.

When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?

All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.

One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.

How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?

It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.

Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!

I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...

Not yet. What do you know about it?

Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!

It look nicer then home!

Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.

That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.

She took off in the night!

Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.

It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.

I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.

A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.

I know. It won't go unnoticed.

The standard ten.

It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.

Know who I am, Jake?

And these cops? What do they get?

Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.

After you cut her loose.

It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.

And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?

It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...

Let's go, Jake?

Jake, I mean, come on --

I told you, use less powder.

Tonight. Just me.

So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!

We'll use the Euc.

I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.

Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.

You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?

Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.

Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.

Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?

LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!

What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?

You interested in a little work?

Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?

You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.

You get an equal cut.

Uh-huh.

Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.

Are you asking me if I have something to prove?

Intuition.

Don't ruin this for me.

I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.

You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.

No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.

Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.

There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.

Then shut up.

You sure we're clear?

What do we need another Shill for?

But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!

There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.

Escorts!

Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.

Of what? They're both crooks.

My fucking heart bleeds.

Then who's the Banker?

I can handle it.

You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.

We're here.

It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.

No. Thanks.

Maybe another time.

All men are cheats.

A couple I know are getting married.

South African women are very sporty.

She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.

Not entirely.

You mean I won't resist them.

Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.

You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.

You've got such beautiful hands.

Tension. It'll go.

Marion. It's a book.

You were talking in your sleep.

Never. Why do you ask?

I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.

I want to buy a car.

Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.

Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that

There's a casino in this hotel.

I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.

I don't gamble.

That's fine.

Then you're not a pro.

I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.

Let it go.

I told you, all bets are off.

The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.

Are you going to put a spell on me?

If I see you do it again, I'll report it.

That bitch? No.

No thanks.

Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.

Don't worry.

I'll tell you later.

I put them on together.

Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.

Jack.

No.

We check every four days.

Any exceptions?

I don't gamble.

How?

Fine.

I read that with a quantum increase of seven.

I hope it's not the oven again.

Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?

We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.

It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.

Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...

I read the same here.

-- open quantum latches --

Energy shielding positive function.

Bomb?

All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?

Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.

Mafhkin oble groop...

Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?

Commander Powell is dead.

I hereby name this star Fred.

Who cares?

I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.

Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...

Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!

I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.

Ah... pity, pity...

Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?

Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.

No?

That's not why we're here.

How come I never hearda you before?

What the hell are you doing?

It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.

Police drone.

No time.

I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.

Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.

Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.

I ain't mad at you...

Later.

Am I?

And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.

Hello...

Are we in some kind of trouble?

Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?

Mommy, where are you?

Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.

We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.

Logan Cale.

Can we go somewhere and talk?

The one you're wearing?

Wasn't that hard.

People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.

No, I meant this.

How much do you know?

Hardly...

The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.

She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.

I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.

Look, thank you for this but--

And you still think you can do something to change that.

Zack... He made it... He's alive...

She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.

Can't help you.

I'll wait.

A friend of your fiance's.

To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.

With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.

You're also a fool.

Then what?

Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.

I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.

Here's your money.

Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.

You're crazy.

Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...

More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...

Where?

They don't have a lot of moving parts.

But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.

I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.

You're the best, Maxie.

I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.

I'm the victim here.

She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.

How'd you get her out of town?

None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.

Shut-up...

What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.

I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.

Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.

I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.

You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?

Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.

Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.

Believe it.

Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.

Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.

Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.

Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.

Disco blows dogs for quarters.

Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?

Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.

The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar

Curly.

Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.

...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...

Nah. Couldn't be.

And if it ain't cleaned off?

No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?

Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?

Sure.

Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?

All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.

Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.

Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.

It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.

Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.

Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!

Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.

Let's lift up her shirt.

Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!

A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.

Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.

No, you gimme your gun, boy!

Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...

Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.

Donnie.

-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.

If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.

I didn't say shit.

We just want to guide you in the right direction.

Sure.

He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.

That's easy. Antiseptics.

No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.

I'm going home.

I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?

No... Donnie, wait. I've never...

Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.

Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.

But you're OK?

Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.

It's safe here.

Who's Frank?

We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.

I guess she just lost faith in the world.

I know, Dad.

Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.

How so?

Yes.

Gretchen. We're going together now.

Four times... so far.

I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.

Have you told Gretchen about the spears?

Have you ever made love, Donald?

What did you want for Christmas that year?

Where are we going?

Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.

Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.

I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.

You're not a bitch.

Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.

Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.

Raspberry.

Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.

I stole four beers from my dad.

She's alive, sweetie.

I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.

Oh God, I'm dead...

Really, Loretta?

Your parents'd kill you.

What?!

Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.

It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.

Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.

You heard me. Where is it?

Here, have some.

Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.

Yes, Leslie!

I know.

I'll be right back. See ya later.

All right, they're makin' a movie.

My dress'll reek.

Mm-hm.

"U.S.A. is A-okay."

Tammy Curry?

We're not in the showroom, Dear.

Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.

Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.

Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.

Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!

Nothin' too showy!

Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?

That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.

Shut up, Hank. This here's business.

Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.

I want to have the big bag of little donuts.

What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!

He should be king!

"My"...

I'll have to enclose the check first.

Send for my car...

But you're my father -

Take a letter...

I wanna powder my nose...

What's the matter with you?

I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.

Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?

That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.

You told it to me.

We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?

Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.

All right -- I'll go out and find one.

If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...

The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 

Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...

This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.

Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.

You swine!

No, that wasn't it...

No... it was a seven letter word.

That's it...

You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?

Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.

That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.

But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.

Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 

Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?

That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.

Two, please.

Do you?

I'll get my bag.

Everything will be seen to.

Good morning, sir.

Indeed!

Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.

I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.

Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.

Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?

He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?

Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.

Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.

You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.

O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.

I knew you'd understand. Here.

Good day, Mr. Merrick.

Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.

y-y-yes--

That's much better. I could understand that "yes".

Say "Mmmerrick."

Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.

Of course! What did you think?

Oh, our relatives... the children.

Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.

Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.

Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?

You too, my friend. Goodnight.

I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?

I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.

Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.

A dressing bag.

Welcome home, John.

Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.

I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.

These? What are THESE? They're swords.

PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!

Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.

Yes.

"The fifth one this week"!

And I thought you said it was something special...

And the week before that?

No... no...

It was my master Keitel's idea.

I see the world.

That I cannot tell you.

The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.

That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...

Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...

Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.

Yes... oh, yes...

The important thing is not to panic.

Yes.

Shut up.

What -- rape?

What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?

Well you started it.

Why... should YOU care?

Well... no...

You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.

Come on, move it!

I know!

The sun! That's it!

Why should WE care?

Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...

Like fish.

No! Arrgh!

Oh... er... yes...

But how could he know... unless...

How about making friends?

I will join my grandfather there.

We'd be the first!

I was sitting there.

We haven't got a spare place.

He hasn't.

No, I'm not.

Bastard.

That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.

Mum! Dad!

Got you!

What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?

Can't make enough swords!

But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..

The Age of Ragnarok ends...

That's right.

Well... I... I thought...

YOU do it!

Help!

Like you got rid of Snorri!

By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...

I know, Dad.

You went berserk...

Neither am I.

Me too.

I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!

They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.

I told you that later.

Hi.

Okay, I guess.

Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.

I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.

It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.

Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.

Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.

Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.

Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.

It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --

Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?

No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?

Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.

Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.

I do have a tendency to use that word too much.

Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

You didn't say anything about my hair.

Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.

I want to have a baby.

No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.

What was I wearing?

But you weren't. I could tell.

Come up and see me... now.

Is that what you want?

Not yet. Not married.

Okay.

Seems too coincidental that way.

Female.

What are you doing?

I walked out the door. There's no more memory.

I love you.

Says you were a bully...

What old mill? Is that somewhere we --

I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?

Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?

I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.

Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?

I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!

I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.

I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.

No. I just need some space, maybe.

I had a good time last night. I really did.

We'll speak soon.

Sorry. I just --

I better do this, Stan.

You found us okay?

This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.

Thanks, Stan.

Can I... I brought some --

Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.

Is that Nietzsche?

Alexander Pope?

I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.

I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.

I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.

Yeah, probably a good idea.

Then check the connections.

She likes you okay.

This one's history. Moving on...

Jesus, Patrick!

Clockworks.

How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?

I'm staying with the Countess.

No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."

So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?

'Drugged' is a stupid word.

She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?

She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?

Yep.

Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?

Bonanza Jellybean?

Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.

Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...

I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...

I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.

Don't start with me, Cooper.

I'll get him.

On my way.

You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.

No, he didn't.

Trauma.

His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.

No.

Hear what?

What happened?

Pressure?

Thank you.

Yes, sir!

Justin. I won't let you die.

Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.

I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.

This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.

Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.

What you got, Peters?

The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.

...how's the client?

...you okay?

Do it.

Justin.

Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.

Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.

Where has it been for the last seven years?

Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?

They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.

It's complicated...

There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.

Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.

I don't know.

I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.

Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --

We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.

Son of a bitch!

Then who the fuck are you?

NOOO!

Where is it?

Starck, give me a read.

Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.

She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.

Come again, Skipper?

Let's go.

Radiation interference?

Keep your eyes open.

So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?

Do it. Dr. Weir...

Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...

"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?

Yes.

DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.

You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?

Not according to the computer.

Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?

It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.

Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.

All boards are green, everything's five by five.

How?

Yes.

Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.

It wants me. I have to go.

My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.

I wouldn't know anything about that.

Victor did.

Oh, he did.

Victor must've taken him.

To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.

And you can? Power it up?

He's made a few changes.

Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?

I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?

If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.

Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --

Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.

'Course not. Strictly business.

Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.

Give me the god damn mirror!

Go back to the drawing board.

Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.

That's terrible news...

Stay right. Left is trouble.

The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.

But all these people...

Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?

You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --

Showtime.

That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."

It's been changed.

Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...

Yes, thanks.

You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.

That's what we're here to find out.

I'm sure I can come up with something.

Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --

A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.

Sure.

So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.

Victor, are you feeling alright?

I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.

I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.

Arnold. What's happening?

I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.

Of course.

If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.

Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.

You really want me to put all this stuff back on?

Don't strain yourself.

They're not home yet.

Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.

It's just Linda. And Mark from school.

No.

No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.

Dad says you're late again, you butthole!

Dad says!

O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?

I don't know.

Come on...

He's my friend, too.

I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.

Yeah?

No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?

Fascinating.

That's me, Merv.

Naw. Any good?

Believe it.

Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.

What variables?

There's nothing to it.

Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.

I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.

Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?

I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.

It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.

I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.

You're right. I didn't tell you that.

He's not coming.

He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.

There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.

That's the name they gave me.

Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?

Learning about Cuba. Having some food.

I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?

Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.

I don't know. I guess so.

No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.

No problem.

Thanks. So do you.

I don't know. Wherever you want.

It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?

Yes... I am really nineteen.

Yeah. It's my sister's.

Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.

Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.

Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.

Hi, Stacy. How are you?

I'd like that.

Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.

Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.

Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."

Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.

Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.

Naked.

WHAT?

Dobermans don't talk.

They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.

Hell, no!

Jesus! Did I say that?

Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.

You whore!

I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.

Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!

Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.

Not much. Why?

What for?

That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?

Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.

Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.

I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.

BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.

Do it! I want to get HIGHER!

Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...

You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.

She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.

You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.

Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.

Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!

You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.

Where'd you get this?

We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.

No! I swear I'm not!

I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.

Um, yeah, thirty miles east.

Yeah.

Where's that?

And the rest of 'em?

Easy.

Oh yeah?

My truck.

Just cover me. It was built to move.

It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.

But --

The girl's got rhythm.

What?

Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.

Huh?

Holds four.

Seven.

I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.

F-f-fuck you.

Duh hickey.

What?

There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?

BONSAI!

Nothing, just lookin'.

They'll tear this place down within the hour.

So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.

Let's lock off this room.

All right.

Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.

Um, well...

Well...

I said I'm not lying.

'Forgive'...? For What?

Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --

But I'm the one up there on the screen.

I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.

I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'

He's not here.

What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.

He knows, Frances.

In my eyes, officer.

Claire?

All square, Doc.

Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.

Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.

See you next weekend, Dad.

Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?

He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.

Is Kaminski a Communist?

I know.

You really want to go?

I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.

Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.

I don't care, Dad. I love you.

Thank you.

Oh Angela, my own... Angela!

Then don't go to Hollywood.

Not me. But other people seem to.

Yeah, well --

Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.

Enh.

I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.

Quietly.

I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...

What?

Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.

Well, the studio told me not to.

Forget it.

Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.

For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.

Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.

Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?

Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.

I know. Don't tell anyone.

...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.

No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.

Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?

Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.

What'd you do?

Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...

Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.

You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.

I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.

I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --

Your big speech?

The speech? Real good.

Mama, what's...

Mama...?

You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.

No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.

Thank you for understanding, Mama.

I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.

Excuse me.

Don't I know you?

Why, Doctor! We've only just met!

I see.

All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.

Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.

Stay calm, please.

You're telling me you feel guilty.

She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."

Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.

'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!

Frances, I'm warning you...

No!

No!

You're kidding.

You drove him to his torment.

The music? Or the fire?

I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.

You speak.

A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.

SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!

Quite right!

Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?

It's been months. It's not like him.

He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!

It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.

Quite a send-off, isn't it?

I'll have to do better than that.

To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...

Not as weak as I.

Your decision. For us.

...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.

But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?

So do I.

A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.

I have been waiting for this ever since.

They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.

Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?

Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.

But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.

Nothing in moderation, Clerval.

He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.

Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.

Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!

That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.

No. They don't.

Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.

Only if you'll tell me who he is.

So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?

Despite the lack of challenge.

I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.

Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?

The strain was evident.

Good night, Brenda.

I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.

Sure.

You're right. It makes no sense.

I don't know.

Almost five.

Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.

Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...

Where's Ned?

Dancer.

Whatever you make yourself.

Sometimes I only think about kissing women.

Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.

Coach, athletic director somewhere.

Lead the way!

Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.

But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.

I got to.

I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.

You've made a science out of coincidence.

Another coincidence.

Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.

So let's do it.

To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!

Jacob.

Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!

Sorry, I need everybody.

Yes, she is.

Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.

Real McCoy.

I was a minister.

How do I know you'll keep your word?

No, I didn't.

I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.

Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.

Pass.

I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.

Forever together.

I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.

My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.

You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.

So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.

No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.

Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!

We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.

Daddy's dead.

-- you got your microwave --

I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.

Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?

I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."

What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!

I wasn't scratching!

This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!

I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.

No.

They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.

That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.

-- This conversation is over.

Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.

What?

She's in the other room.

Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.

What?

What?

Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.

This ain't the time.

I did?

What?

Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.

Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.

Don't say my name.

Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?

Your prerogative, Senator.

Standing right here in my office.

Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.

The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.

Wouldn't dream of it, sir.

"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!

Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.

I'm not sure what --

Motherachrist...

Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...

That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.

There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...

Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.

What changed?

If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.

I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.

I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.

It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.

Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...

Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!

You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.

I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.

Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.

Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?

Blank faces here, O'Neil.

Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.

Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?

This has nothing to do with you.

Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.

I saw an article...

It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.

That's a good story.

Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?

Just askin'

Maybe half.  Not even.

Educate her, Pyro.

Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?

It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.

Should I be afraid?

We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.

Sure.  Just like your men do.

Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.

Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.

That your desk?  I'll take this one.

Shut your hole, Slutnik.

Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?

Go in there. Talk to her.

Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.

Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?

Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.

Only one way to find out.

No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...

Sure. I'd like that.

I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.

Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.

So have dinner with me tonight.

Not now. You got my bag?

Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?

Where's Luc and Pierre?

Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!

We know.

Yeah, you're the worm guy.

They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.

You're standing on it.

No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.

But you don't know for sure!

Last time you didn't even scratch it!

We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.

Oh.

Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.

I am not permitted to speak of such things.

Sure.

It's okay. I know her.

Come with me. I'll explain on the way.

...Damn you!  Damn you!

COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...

"Just!?"

We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!

Like YOU know?

What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?

Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,

The engines are dead. We're drifting.

I don't know... It just wasn't like him.

The ships are gaining...

FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!

It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...

No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.

We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.

Okay, that's where you want to be.

No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.

Up.

No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.

All systems are working, Commander.

That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?

So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!

Right.

Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..

Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.

It's ... incredible.

Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.

No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?

Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?

BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!

No. Keep all energy to the armor.

Hey, YOU want to drive?

We're doing episode 31?

We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.

You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...

One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'

Tell them? About...

Let me think. I need time to think.

Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.

This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.

You are so full of shit

Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.

I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!

Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.

Simpler.

Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.

Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.

Home.

Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.

Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?

It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.

NO, Thank God he has not.

Well... Sort of...

And determination.

Wh... Where are we?

Okay, let's go.

What does she see in them?

You seem pleased by the prospect.

But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?

Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.

Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!

That can't be.

I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.

Yes, William.  I am apologizing.

Yes, my lord.

More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.

That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.

Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!

March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!

Yes, I believe so.

I'm not sure.

George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.

Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.

As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.

Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?

Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!

I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?

I understand, George.

Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.

I only meant...

Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!

I rode here, on my horse.

My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...

My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.

Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.

Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.

I want you to see our hospital.

Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.

Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?

You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.

But not more than your comfort.

Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.

George, I'm sorry.

Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?

Or, 'civilized'.

That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...

I see...

Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.

So where's the money?

Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.

That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.

Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?

I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.

Calm down, Bear...

No shit? What're some of 'em?

Sure. Family. I know how that goes.

I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.

That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.

What?

You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?

Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.

That's the magic number.

By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.

Who?

Or else use your fucking imagination.

That's correct. Look at me.

'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.

Yeah? Which terminal?

He owes me money.

Movie producer? Yeah, why not.

I want you to keep looking right here, okay?

We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.

Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?

So you don't work for the casino?

They always paid.

Once.

I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.

Harry, look at me.

It's not bad when you know what it's about.

Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".

No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.

I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.

Let's see how we get along.

Who?

Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...

Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.

Personally?

Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.

Ask your man here.

If you'd like to tell me, yeah.

One of mine?

Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.

Buddy?

I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?

I'm up twelve grand today.

At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.

I know who he works for. Where's your phone.

That's right. Three percent.

A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.

...That's what we finally decided.

"Cotton".

Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.

Don't go out of your way.

I just caught the end.

Sounds fair.

You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.

Depends, who pays?

Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?

Hey, Chili? Look at me.

Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...

Go get your stuff.

Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.

You said don't say nothing and I didn't.

How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?

Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.

Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.

Come on in.

Murray's dead.

Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.

Harry -

'We?'

Shylock?

I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.

North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.

What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.

Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?

Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.

We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.

Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.

Why not.

Maureen?

Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?

Bring it on, dude.

Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.

Maybe he isn't alone.

A what?

Hell no. You think I'm crazy?

What?

Smugglers maybe.

It's a risk I'm willing to take.

What is it?

Turbine rotor's shot.

Three, four days.

What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.

Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.

Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.

Right.

Maybe you can tell me then.

Don't lie to me!

Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!

Probably didn't have time.

Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.

You're a pal.

Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.

So what did happen?

You're more practical than superstitious.

For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.

Did you see him?

It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.

We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.

Epps.

I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.

Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.

Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.

Hey.

Wish I could say the same.

Victims of what?

What's that supposed to mean?

I think I see it pretty well.

Of course they did.

You got that right.

So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.

Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.

Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.

Moving to Sweden.

And look what happened.

You don't remember?

Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!

Shut up.

The mooring hasn't come taught.

Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.

So whoever did this now has our shotgun.

Leave it.

You think whoever did this is reasonable?

Fine with me.

You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.

Not the Maxine?

God, how horrifying.

I made spaghetti. Do you want some?

Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.

Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!

Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...

Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.

Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...

Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."

It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...

As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...

Well, yes...

Huh?

But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?

You can count on me, sir!

But I was only trying to be friendly...

Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.

Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.

SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.

Why?

You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.

That's just the way I am!

It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!

I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...

Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...

Hey Josh.

Good.

Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."

Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.

You lent it to me in like tenth grade.

Why do I always have to do it?

I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"

It's still twenty-five minutes early.

I'm going to tell him you said that.

I can't believe it!

I dunno...

He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.

Bingo!

It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?

Forget it, I can't explain it...

It's always closed...

Let's go hassle Josh.

Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.

We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.

What? Where?!

You cunt!

God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.

Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!

Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...

We were such desperate sluts back then.

I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...

Fuck it. Everything must go!

I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...

I can't imagine spending money on towels.

What thing?

Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.

It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!

I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.

Great...

You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!

Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!

Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!

Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...

I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.

A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.

Seymour does.

I know it's over, asshole, I --

Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!

What?

I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."

Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.

Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.

Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?

These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.

That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...

Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?

If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?

Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.

No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...

Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...

Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...

That's the spirit!

Really?

Who knows?

How can you be so sure?

What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?

Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...

It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...

Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.

Can you at least let me in?

Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.

Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."

At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!

I dunno, I...

They're Seymour's.

Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.

She's not at home?

Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.

So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?

Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!

Am I to take it you want to live?

In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.

Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.

-not a time for modesty, Bob-

We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.

That is correct.  Nothing.

Might be exciting for you.

I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.

-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.

Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.

But you said they were always old.

That's very considerate.

I can try.

It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.

It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.

You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 

Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?

Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.

Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 

Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.

You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...

Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.

I expect so- it's from my wife.

I have to ask- why do you need me?

Underneath.  Somewhere.

It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- 

I don't believe you had a mother. 

Four should do it.

Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?

Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.

Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?

We don't have a relationship.

I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.

Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.

How is he these days?

Does he ever mention me?

I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.

Okay, let's take a look.

Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.

I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.

Good-bye, Peter.

Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.

Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.

So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.

Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?

Now you're talking.

It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.

Tonight?

I don't think we should leave her alone.

Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.

My pleasure.

The Upper West Side.

Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.

Who are they?

Maybe they just want to appeal.

Do I?

Yes.

Did I forget something?

Like what?

Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.

I knew that.

You need the exercise.

You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?

Oh, hiya, Pete.

Who?  Just -- someone we know.

It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.

Okay, let's heat 'em up!

I'm Peter --

It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?

I hate Jello.

Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?

Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?

Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.

The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.

Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.

Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.

Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.

I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.

I don't think he's ready for the toaster.

And decent.

It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.

Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.

Uuuuuuugh!!

No.  They're just coming to me.

No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.

Well, let's check it out.

I told you, I ...

This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.

That's it.  Get out.

All right.

Goodbye.

The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.

I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.

"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.

I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.

I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.

Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.

Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.

No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.

One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.

I think it's the food of the future.

What is it?

Here are tonight's calls.

Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.

The magic word is "please."

Why do you want to see it?

Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.

See!  They are using drugs.

You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?

On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.

Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?

Yeah, I can smell it.

What?

Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?

She said he was "the Destructor."

We'd better adjust our streams.

Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.

Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.

Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.

No sense worrying about it now.

So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.

Sit tight.  I'm on my way.

I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.

It's not good, Pete.

Mmmhmmm.

Right.  We'll believe anything.

Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?

Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.

Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.

Yes?  Go on!

Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.

Caesar?

Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.

I'm serious.

Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.

Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.

Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?

I'll nose around...

That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.

The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!

God of passages and changes?

You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.

But have never been?

You're hearing about somebody else.

I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?

Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.

They can't... if this is Rome...

Sneaking around with your brother?

I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.

"But what if I wish to be purple?"

Would that Marcus had lived.

You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...

Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.

What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.

My troops don't make policy.

Isn't the helmet magnificent?

Greeks?

They're studying with Cynics.

I can see that...

We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.

I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...

No!

How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...

You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.

I didn't get killed and everyone else did.

Alive... I'm alive...

What the hell are you talking about, Greek?

Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?

Right, right, what am I thinking of?

You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?

Hello.

Yes.

If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.

No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.

No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.

I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.

Of course not.

Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!

You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.

Oh my God --

GET OUT!

No.

Here he comes.

All right then! Yes!

What did she say?

If you want.

I don't understand.

But Elaine --

Yes.

I have to go back now.

Why wouldn't it?

Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.

He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.

Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?

Yes I am.

Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.

Who screamed?

Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.

All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?

You heard me. Out of here.

Because I don't like you.

All right. Put it in the room where we were.

-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --

Uh -- The Taft Hotel.

It's in the main ballroom.

Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.

Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.

It's down the hall.

No.

Is what a girl?

That's right.

Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?

When is he coming back?

No.

Yes.

Like what?

We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.

Benjamin?

Oh. Well, goodnight.

Yes, I have --

Let me out!

Yes. Yes. Let me out!

I've got to go.

A drink? Of course.

What?

I haven't. No.

I'll be up in five minutes.

Isn't there something you want to tell me?

The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.

I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?

What?

You're welcome.

Wait a minute!

INADEQUATE!

Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.

How about art.

Don't you?

Neither.

Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.

Can I undress and talk at the same time?

About five years.

No.

Not exactly.

No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.

I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --

All right. Now let's get to bed.

Yes.

Art.

I don't think we were the first.

That's enough.

Don't talk about Elaine?

Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.

But why shouldn't I?

Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.

You're not.

Are you?

Of course you did.

Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.

If that's how you feel --

That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.

But if it's sickening for you --

But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.

Where is Elaine?

I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?

I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --

Sir?

Very good, sir.

Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.

But I don't want you to make up something.

I do.

Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --

We haven't.

What about it?

No.

That has nothing to do with it --

Ben -- how old are you now?

That's a hell of a good age to be.

I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --

What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?

Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.

Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.

Why?

Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?

I'd like to discuss this.

They are?  Come on.

Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.

Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 

Splendid!

Yes.

The pearls are in her room.

No --

What about the money?

How?

You might find a bullet through that head...

Not with strangers.

Oh -- work!!

No -- why? -- should I?

Of course.

Then dance the next number with Kringelein.

I feel sorry for him.

I fell in love last night -- the real thing.

Why do you hide in my room?

You mustn't talk Russian to me.

And...?

I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 

No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.

I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.

Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.

Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 

Oh -- yes but -- later.

No?

Why do you think --

Yes -- I will be on the train.

Do I know him -- I know him through and through.

Yes, quite.

No thanks -- keeping my head clear.

I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.

Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.

Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.

How's the beautiful lady?

No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.

Be quiet.

Good heavens. What for?

No, Doctor.

Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 

I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.

Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.

Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.

No.

Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.

I never danced before -- in public.

Yes --

Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.

Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.

Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.

Moreover...

Moreover...

Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.

That's from skiing.

Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...

Can't you understand me?

I understand perfectly.

Oh, yes.

I had to arrange about the trip.

Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?

Shhh -- here he is now.

We have a good many connections in England, naturally.

All you have to do is phone for it.

Then, it's all over?

Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 

We did not approach you.

Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.

The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!

Oh, yes, Suzette.

I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?

In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.

I'm cancelling the engagement.

I don't know you.

I could not think of not accepting.

He tried to rob me -- he is dead --

I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.

You are late. Hurry.

When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.

Have I kept you waiting?

Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.

I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--

I want to keep my teeth.

My son was in the hospital --

It'll never happen again. I swear.

You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?

I'll loan you a raincoat.

You mean, the insurance frammis?

Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.

Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.

Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.

Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?

Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?

Goody!

Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.

Henry, no!

Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.

Well, make it stop!

My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.

Why? What's wrong?

You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.

Just myself.

Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.

Fair enough.

Only one tooth?

My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.

Bluebell came in?

You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?

I pay my debts.

I've really got to --

You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.

Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.

You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.

No.

Oh, you'll live, Lilly.

Uh-huh.

I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.

Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.

You taught me a lot. Then I invented.

Always, for you, baby.

Taking you for granite?

Oh, don't be stupid.

We'll rent a car.

I'll sign that affidavit.

You already went back to work.

Oh, come on, Roy.

Where?

Upstate where?

That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?

Sure.

Open your door.

) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!

I saw her.

You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.

For Christ's sake, why not?

No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.

Not many.

No question, huh?

Oh, yeah. That's that.

We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.

Happy to see you looking so good.

Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?

The cemetery...

Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.

No shit.

Nothing's missing?

And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.

Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.

I don't know.

Get on the bus.

John, you can't help her now.

Where'd you get it?

You stole it?

I'm okay.

Okay... thank you.

What?

Yeah.

Oh, right.  Sorry.

Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.

Guess so ...

The voice man!  He's here!

But I've seen him!

You can't expect us to stay here --

Here.  Let me try.

Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'

To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.

You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.

Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.

Samhain.

I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.

Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.

Didn't recognize you.

I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.

Must have changed that law.

After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!

The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.

When?

It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.

Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.

I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?

I dunno.

In what way, pray tell?

Tit for tat--as simple as that.

If what?

How are you, honeybunch?

The posies are for her?

For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.

You're making a joke.

Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!

Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?

Out!  Out!

Thank God!

As a matter of fact--

Where's Mom?

I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?

She has a master's degree in English literature.

He insults him all the time.

Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.

Dad was never in England?

Wow.

Mhravitch.

Uck.

I don't know.

Where did you get the poison?

Mhravitch.

Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.

Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.

Sir?

Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?

Leave a tip.

Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!

How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?

Give us time.

Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.

You'd better get Dr. Woodly.

We thought it was an emergency.

He's a very decent man, Harold.

I could carve a better man out of a banana!

It's so--so stark.

"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."

You're wrong.

I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.

It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.

If he wants to go.

It's a big and busy funeral home.

I'm teaching my son to be a man.

No.

Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.

Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.

Oh dear.

Ahh--then she's still alive.

What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--

I've never heard of it.

More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.

This little corpse is intended as a lesson?

The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.

Yes.

Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!

If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.

King Arthur.

And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.

If you want to be found that way.

I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.

My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--

Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?

Don't!

Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.

I'll kill myself.

You're the only woman he ever took out.

Who have you been talking to?

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

That man is your father.

He can hardly talk.

He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.

Doing what?

Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.

That's something I suppose.

When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.

Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.

We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.

He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.

You figure!

A what?

He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.

We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?

I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?

Tonight's the night.

It is?

As long as he keeps out of the park.

It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.

And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!

Paul's only twelve years old.

He's not your son.

I believe in miracles now.

Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?

I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.

You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?

He died of a massive rupture.

You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!

It's good.  Let him go.

Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.

It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.

No.

But is she, has...

Big threat. TV would ream you.

You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?

I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.

Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.

Are you going to stiff me?

Wait?

Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...

What's that shade of blue called?

Yes. I think it'll look better.

Yeah. How did you know?

She thinks so.  What do you do?

Do you know where she lives?

Last I heard he went to San Diego.

Three hundred?

Half now, half later.

What rate?

No.

Tijuana.

Fuck.

Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?

Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.

You really believe all that?

What makes you so sure?

Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.

I'm back in Grand Rapids.

That's like a stag film.

Hmm.

I don't know.

Do you think she's safe?

I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.

It's just a name.

Just leave me alone.

They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.

Pretty good.

What plan?

That's not true, Mr...?

That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.

I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.

I want to meet Ratan.

Who?

That's all right.

Film making can be pretty expensive...

If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.

Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?

Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.

Oh.

To anybody.

Well, he can just fuck himself.

You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.

You working in San Diego now?

How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.

Oh, I don't have one.

Possession of a stolen shovel.

I'm a file clerk.

A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?

I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.

What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.

What?

Your hearse?

No.

That's really great.

Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?

What do you mean?

I don't know. Just one of those. 

Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.

Look.

Over there by the courthouse.

No more revolts.

Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.

I don't know.

Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.

Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.

Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."

Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.

Well, why don't you?

Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.

Where's that?

Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.

Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.

I've never met her. My mother set it up.

What is it, Harold?

Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?

... of you. You'll all end up like this.

Well, they're my species.

I don't know. Perhaps.

We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.

They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.

To whom?

No, thank you. They stain my fingers.

Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.

Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...

Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.

Why?

Ah, yes.

I go to funerals.

No.

Yes.

Yes.

I burnt down the Chemistry building.

I'd have liked to talk to him.

During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.

Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.

ZAT!

Yes.

Eh?

Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.

Harold!

Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?

No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.

I knew you'd come.

Don't waste your tears. Look at him!

I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.

Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.

I'm a girl who keeps her promises.

What's the matter with her?

Are you crazy?

Finish what?

No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.

The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.

See what??

You mean, outside... with her.

I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!

Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.

See? I don't like that --

I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --

Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.

No. It was red. Bright red.

Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.

I know where to find him. I'll get him back.

How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!

Impressive. Do you remember what it said?

You're doing fine.

Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.

"Myers", huh? You have a first name??

Noooo! Noooo!!!

When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.

Those things never work. Never.

I won't take 'em. They never work.

No. Don't --

Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.

C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.

No. I never was.

Hostage negotiations.

No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.

What?

Hi.

Do you really need this bed, lady?

Uh-huh.

Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.

HE did. I've seen him.

Stay the fuck away from me.

It's important.

I don't remember.

Oh Christ.

This isn't happening.

Oh.

Oh.  Oh yes.

I don't want to see the dress.

Forget him.

Tell me who you are.

Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?

You promised me an explanation.

A box?

Who did?

I said no.

Which is where?

Where's Daddy?

I saw everything.

You mean we're moving in?

I hear you.

It looks like a bomb's dropped.

I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.

Are you O.K.?

Fine.

Please. I can't bear it...

It's better you see for yourself --

Just soda.

No.

Yeah, why don't I?

My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.

Try me.

I found a room.

I've forgotten.

I love you, honey.

Maybe you should give it some time.

She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.

What?

Of course.

Finished?

What's the problem?

Just upstairs.

Are you alright ?

What things?

I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.

What's next?

Say it.

Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"

We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.

Oh, so what's the point then?

Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?

I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.

I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.

I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.

Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?

To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.

How do you know about that?

That's why you got the gig, isn't it?

That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --

So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?

We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.

What do you think?  Dick likes it.

That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.

No, you can't.

Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?

They always seemed...

Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"

Nobody.

Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?

Oh, hi.

So.  Is now a good time?

Oh boy... In the club, or at home?

OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.

What do you mean, four more?

That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?

Nice friend.

What's his name?

Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?

Uh...yes, at the moment.

There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?

Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?

Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.

The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?

I want a tape.

-- FUCK OFF!

Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.

I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.

Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.

We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...

We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?

I should be so lucky.

Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.

And do you like it that way?

I don't know.

What, what?

Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?

Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?

Fine.  One.

I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...

I guess.

Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.

I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.

It was kind of funny.

You still together?  Going all right?

Oh ho, so very infrequently.

Uh... No.

I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.

It'll have to be sex, then.

I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?

It was like sex.  What else could it be like?

Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.

Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.

You're tougher.

You're being stupid.

That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.

I'm going to talk to you.

I mean it.

Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.

I don't know.

Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --

-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.

It's true!

It's a crematorium.

What difference does it make?

No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.

Enough of what?

No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.

Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --

Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.

Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?

Yes.  You?

I'm sure it isn't.

Oh, right.  Alright.

I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.

God, you ask a lot of questions.

Everything all right?

Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...

What do you mean?  Where did she go?

It's the best collection I've ever seen.

Sixty.

And I won't take a penny over ninety.

I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.

Well we don't.

I'm Vince.

Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.

P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.

Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.

Go to hell.

This one came unassembled.

Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.

I don't follow you.

Carl Smith.

You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.

Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?

I've been to Church Hill.

Not your concern.

He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.

Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.

It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.

Yes.

There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.

I see.

What about that family in '31?

Is that a threat?

Will I see you again?

I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!

The inheritance.

Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.

All I need is for you to check the name.

It's that important?

Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.

I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?

You'll not be bringing the church into this.

-In nomine sanctus esperitu-

I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.

Pheasant.

Why are you here?

You know me home.  Me name.

You are still so very young.

There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.

I do not think I like the sound of that.

I feel hardly nothing.

That is not me.

I have no future husband.

What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.

So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.

You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.

Mulet.

Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.

Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.

Have you time for some- thing to eat?

Figure she's with him?

How many came?

What are you doing here?

Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.

Offered the Pope one of his whores.

I've had a few more concerns.

MACLEOD!

This isn't done.  Get up.

I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.

Leave her alone.

Are you here?

I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.

American.

Do you?

But I had heard his wounds were mortal.

The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?

We were very close.

I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.

It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.

He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.

No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.

He certainly -- hic -- does!

And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?

I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.

Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.

I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!



How?

Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.

And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.

Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.

What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?

Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --

You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.

I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.

Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!

Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.

All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!

What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?

Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?

Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.

Just what I said. That's what I --

Listen, Walter --

Dead?

Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?

Keep away --

That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"

Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --

Bermuda... Rich, eh?

He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?

Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?

Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?

Say, could I meet him?

All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?

So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.

Especially with an election coming up in a few days.

Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.

Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.

Hold on a minute.

Yes. Where is he?

I know. Where is he, I said.

All right, Walter.

Is he coming back here?

I'm finished.

I'm looking at you -- you murderer!

Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?

Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?

What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!

Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.

A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!

Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!

What would you do if it was a daughter?

Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!

What's that -- what's that?

You know you did!

Western an' Thirty-fourth.

Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.

What?

I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --

Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.

It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.

Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?

In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.

I know, I just want to give him a thrill.

Three bullets! Any good?

All right -- all right!

It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.

What's the use? I can't win a pot.

What's the dope, Sheriff?

I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.

Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?

Three sixes. Is that any good?

Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?

Hang onto her! Keep her in here!

Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.

What do I know about Williams?

Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.

This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.

You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.

Earl Williams. The reprieve.

I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.

The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!

Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --

We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?

Just -- one -- second!

What?

Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?

It's a frame-up! Some imposter!

I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.

Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.

Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.

Five hundred dollars.

Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.

I'm telling you!

What did you do with her?

Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?

Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.

And up a dime.

But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.

No -- what?

What's the use of fighting, Hildy?

Mother!

That man there!

You didn't mean to kill that policeman?

What are your beliefs, Earl?

Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.

Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?

Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?

Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!

I'll be right here. I won't leave you.

Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!

Huh?

The what?

Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?

No! It's easy -- it's very easy!

You're insane!

Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?

Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.

Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.

I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.

No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.

Looking for shrapnel.

They're not.

It's easy. I've done it.

He's the worst liar.

It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.

It's like telling fibs.

They might be.

Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.

What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.

Weeds will grow, Mac.

Kiss me Hardy.

If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.

Bugger the Buffs.

Well, it's off ration. We know that.

It looks....foreign.

You taste it.

Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.

Who said anything about love?

He's being posted. I was terrible to him.

Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.

...since I used to take you to the Proms?

Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.

A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.

Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.

You might still have a house.

Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.

I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.

You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.

Really, that's a long time.

Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?

What?

What about R.J.?

Who's your Daddy!

Nice.

Yeah, I'll do something.

Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.

I don't.

Yeah, no shit.

Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.

Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."

Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."

Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.

Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?

I don't know.

What's that?

Cat fight, cat fight.

Fuck. I think we blew a tire.

Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.

Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.

He won't move.

Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.

Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.

Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.

It won't work.

Hmmmmm.

Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.

Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.

I hear ya.

Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?

No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.

Tickets for what?

That seems likely.

These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.

Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.

I don't know, I think he's funny.

Shhhhhh.

No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.

Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.

No please, let me sit this one out.

She looks like she stinks.

Yeah, she said we looked queer.

Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.

Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?

A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.

Keys.

What do they call you, sweety?

Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.

Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.

Let's go see.

Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?

Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.

Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.

Shhhh... you hear that?

Over here, inside the smokehouse.

Right.

Yes, sir.

That's it?

Dr. Satan?

Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.

Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?

I always favored the Hulk.

Aw, fuck.

Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.

Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?

That is the wrong fork, young man.

I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?

Not at all.

No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.

Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.

Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.

Yes. Happy happy.

I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.

I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.

Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.

Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.

I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?

Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.

But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.

Unnhh.

God, you're beautiful.

No. You look so beautiful.

I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.

Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.

I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.

Shut up and tell me.

I have a friend you might like to meet.

Please, honey, let me in.

They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."

It's only that I really enjoy your company and...

You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.

I don't think so.  Why?

Yes, darling.

What?

It might behoove us to turn back at this point.

I think he's feral.

Nothing. Be right out.

You have to shave? Like an ape?

You are an animal.

Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.

Really?

How come?

I had sold my fucking soul.

That was wonderful!

Thank you very much for that.

Ummm. It's good.

Ugnh.

Ooka.

And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.

Got it.

It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...

Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.

Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.

Ounpoo. Ungh.

I have to talk. Is that okay?

Yes... Derek.

Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?

Check!

No, I'm fine.

I've never been to Louisville.

Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?

All I want's the money.

Oh, about five hundred.

Twelve thousand.

The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.

Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?

So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.

I told you. I got drunk.

Thanks for the drink.

To do what?

Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?

You think I can lose?

You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.

Kiss off.

Like I told ya. My thumbs.

Miss Packard. How do you do?

Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.

Come on, let's go...

Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.

I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.

I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.

I'm a businessman, kid.

No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?

What's your game? What do you shoot?

What kind of straight pool game you like?

Want some free advice?

You well-heeled, partner?

Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.

Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.

Approximately? One thousand bucks.

Give me a drink, will ya?

Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.

What are ya, chicken, Charlie?

Go on home. Just leave me the money.

Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.

I told you you'd get your money back.

Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.

What for? To play Fats again?

You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?

Is that what you think?

I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.

Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.

Yeah, sure has.

Ten dollars.

Yeah, I'm quittin'.

What?

What bus?

Thanks. I will.

Why not? We already know each other's secrets.

The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?

I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?

Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.

Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.

I've got something in my bag.

I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.

Yes, I'm glad.

Oh, I don't know.

No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.

Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.

Yeah. That's right, too.

Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.

You watch me.

So do you, Fast Eddie.

Yes.

We don't know that --

What's inside?

Yes.

I want to talk.  I just learned again.

Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.

I'll have to go to a new school -- again.

It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.

Because the sky is so clear out here.

This should be the heaviest shower of the year.

That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.

You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!

I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.

What, Jim, what?

It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...

I'll take you to school.

That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.

It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.

Good night.

Yes, Mr. Gardner.

I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.

May I ask why?

No.

Behind my house, up on the ridge.

I don't see anything.

But it's not, Jimmy.

Who are you calling?

All their lines were busy.

This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.

Oh?

Why, yes.

We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.

If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.

Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.

Punched the President? Oh my god.

My ex-husband works in satellite communications.

He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.

What's the bad news?

And the good news is you won't charge me.

Huh? Oh, good, good.

Can you believe this?

Dad, don't start.

She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...

What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!

What'd I say?

Great.

Looks like they're preparing the invasion.

It's not me. They're overriding the system.

Then God help us.

ETA with target; four minutes.

Better than we thought.

I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.

My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...

Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.

It's... slowing down, Sir.

Butt-munch.

I'm a dancer.

It's all fuzzy.

I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.

I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.

You sure?

Above American soil?

The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...

These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.

Air... water... your "sun."

Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?

Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.

It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...

Alexandretta. Now we know.

What?

It's war.

No, Henry. Try not to talk.

Got lost in his own museum, huh?

My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?

I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.

Shooting me won't get you anywhere.

Find something?

You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.

Lower me down.

Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.

He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!

What?

You said go between them!

Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.

No?

So it did.

Don't worry -- I'm fine.

And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?

No, Dad. You did. Forty years.

Well, uh...

I came here to save you.

My lucky charm.

What?

Head for the fireplace!

I'm out, Dad!

Booby traps?

Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!

Hmmm... What did we talk about?

And do I detect a rebuke?

Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."

Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.

Junior...

What did you find, Dad?

Junior?! Dad...

We named the dog Indiana.

That was seven hundred years ago.

Come on -- come on!

They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.

If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.

Just a routine inspection tour.

No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.

Something magical. A sacred rock.

Finally!

No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --

I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.

No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.

I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!

I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.

When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.

Yes, I understand.

I don't like to show off.

At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!

Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --

Okay, Shorty.

That's it. Pankot Palace.

Yeah, that's what happened...

Behind you!

Read you loud and clear, Indy!

Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!

What evil?

Long ago -- before my father's father.

I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.

Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?

Oh yeah?

The old man saw it in a dream.

He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.

Their children?

Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.

It's starting to let go!

Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?

What does the writing say?

That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?

I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.

Just try and control yourself.

Maybe he likes older women.

No -- real food.

You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.

What -- the bug?

I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!

I'm going down.

Maybe... someday.  Not today.

You've got to go to sleep now.

I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...

There's got to be another way out.

They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.

They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.

You're not gonna believe this...

I'm...inside you.

It wasn't him.

Me.

Al.

Yes.

...I need to make a phone call.

It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?

Me? What'd I do?

Kill myself.

Yep.

You're gonna explain.

With a man in my head...

Oh...Gooood!

If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?

No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.

Whatever you do, just...don't stop.

Then what are you stopping for?

I don't know anything. I just want to go home.

You gotta help.

They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.

The airport! Hey, wait a minute.

I'm at the airport.

Send a man there. A secret agent.

Use my credit cards.

Who cares?

You are in trouble. Now do it.

We'll change your appearance.

It's attitude...how you carry yourself.

You'll be me.

The beach.

How else do you get seaweed under your nails?

The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?

Good Idea!

What's happening?

Don't just stand there, say something.

.

Where are you staying?

I made it work.

You have no taste.

Just hold them close and stay still.

The blond...GRUNER. A killer.

She's the toughest to read.

You can't listen. You can't watch either.

What if she says something important?

Oh come on.

I don't know!

Is that all?

It's not your time. I get time off.

That's good. It's not better. Where?

Osaka?

What do I do?

I can't see a thing.

Never mind, just say it.

No. You can't trust her.

Come on.

Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.

Aim what?

And don't let her know, either.

Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.

Rene?

I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.

She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.

Yeah, sure.

That's nice.

It's all we've got.

JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!

RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.

What part what?

Dieter?

I dyed it. We're all getting old.

We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.

They took the tapes.

Yes. Joe.

We insist.

You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?

And how do you service foreigners.

What things?

Remember what?

Oh yeah, thanks...

No, it wasn't, It was intentional.

Been complaning of hallucinations.

You...him...UST.

A little voice in my head.

Nothing.

Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.

Like there's someone else here.

Yes, of course.

Me still. They left you alone?

It's not apparent.

They left. I had to go with them.

Wanted to get to know you.

I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.

No.

He must be a good friend.

What'd he steal?

Oh sure.

It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.

Hong Kong.

...across THE BORDER. Come on!

That I really don't know.

They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.

What?

Why not, what are you going to do?

It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.

Why'd you invite me here?

What about the others.

Tear it apart?

Yes.

Poor bastard.

So we better get started.

She was playing with the Pooh doll.

What's that outside, Daddy?

Monday.

Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...

Get me Wigand.

No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?

Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...

They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.

You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.

Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...

Call me back in ten.

Jim, it's Lowell.

Don't you have to be at the office?

Yes, it's on the stove...

Soy sauce...

Where should I wash them?

It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...

Get some perspective, Lowell.

No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?

I'll call you then.

That's right...

Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.

...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...

What do you mean?

Who are these people?

Good.

I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.

Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?

You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.

Everything interests me.

I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?

Yeah... Thank you.

What I've seen... I've liked.

Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.

Did work.

That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.

Jump in, quick, c'mon...

Good. I want to talk to you.

...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.

No.

I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!

They do this with impunity!

I know. I'm going to go there tonight...

Yeah, great.

You mean... since this morning?

I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.

What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?

What does this have to do with my testimony?

What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!

That's bullshit, Jeff!

For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...

What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?

You called me.

Where you staying now?

Right.

And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?

It acts as a...

I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.

Here. Got pictures.

Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.

Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.

I had no idea until after, but --

A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!

Mr. Dumbarton.

We rest, Your Honor.

It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...

Set one side for Bel Air.

What?

You have the pre-nup?

What do you mean, was.

So, that's good, right?

Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.

Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.

"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."

Did you see the tape?

What does your lawyer think?

You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.

He wants a reconciliation.

To him? He's a sick freak.

Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.

But why him?

Howard is a beautiful person.

I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!

Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?

I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.

No. Don't stop.

Thank you.

Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.

Your mother was.

Yes.

Yes, Miles. I accept.

Do you want to sleep on it?

Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --

I love you. I want to have your baby.

On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.

What kind of "stuff?"

Those are gifts.

You have to leave the house immediately!

No buts. Now. Out.

I thought so.

Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?

My whole metabolism is -- off.

Sometimes I forget.

We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.

Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.

Of Massey Myerson?

I wish I had your discipline.

No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.

Hello Miles.

He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.

I guess.

Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.

Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.

I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.

We've outlined a settlement...

No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.

Seems like there's more of it than ever before --

Maybe I should reconsider my...

What are they?

You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?

I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?

Maybe next time.

Whyuhshe's all right, sir.

Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?

The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to

All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!

I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!

Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.

He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.

I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!

Oh, no.

It'll do no good.  He despises me.

I don't know.

Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"

Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.

No?  Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenif you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.

I haven't the slightest idea.

There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.

Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . .

"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."

Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.

Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?

Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.

You win!

I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.

Yes.

I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?

Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.

Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.

What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?

Beat it! 

Shut up!

Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.

Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but you've been very kind. 

Oh, this?I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.

Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.

Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 

I can't go out like this.

I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.

What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?

No. No. It's too good a story.

Yeah?

Um. You're doing all right.

Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?

How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?

Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.

I don't trust that chatterbox.

Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.

To New York?

I'm following you.

Of course it is.

All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.

knowbut

Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.

Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.

Mind your own business.

Come onget in.

Darling!

Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.

Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.

You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.

Do you know?

You sound like a hobo.

Not interested. 

Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.

You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.

Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.

If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.

Yes?

Just your imagination.

Yeah!

Don't "Joe" me.

To tear down the Walls of Jericho.

Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.

Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.

Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are.

When you sober upcome in and see me.

Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.

I ain't got a hat.

He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.

Who?

Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.

Better start gettin' into your clothes.

I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind. 

Thanks. 

What?

Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to

You're not kidnapping her, are you?

Yeah. Just babies.

You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?

Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...

Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...

Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.

God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.

Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.

Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.

Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.

I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.

...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...

Keep saying what?

So why does he call himself Bertrand?

To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.

Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?

He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.

If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 

No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.

Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?

Did you bag any geese on this trip?

But the boys told us they didn't get any.

Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?

Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!

Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.

Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.

Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.

What?

Hi, Freckle Face.

Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.

The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.

And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?

A Perry Russo?

David Ferrie.

No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.

Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?

I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.

Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.

Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.

Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.

Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.

Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.

You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.

Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.

Tough day.

Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.

You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?

Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!

He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.

Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.

Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.

I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.

I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.

Between six and seven seconds.

Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?

Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.

If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.

Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...

That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.

Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...

Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.

You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?

...and your General?

Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.

Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?

I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?

Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.

Splendid, love to see them.

If you must know, virtually nothing.

Six.

Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.

No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.

Not a problem.

Oh, that's not a problem.

Who?

I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.

Let me finish. Can I finish?

We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.

Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.

Course you didn't.

I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.

She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.

The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.

You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.

Arrest me.

Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?

What's in it?

Fine.

Okay.

What's your brand?

The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.

Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?

You went out this morning and bought a gun.

It looks nice.

I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.

The Delfonics.

If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.

It's not really something I think about.

Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.

Bigger?

Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.

Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.

A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.

Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.

Which one?

People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.

Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.

I know.

I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.

Thanks, but you have a good time.

I beg your pardon?

And cooperate? You might get probation.

Yeah?

He sells guns.

Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.

I thought you were going to let this one through.

A Broadway shopping bag.

And splittin' with her?

Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?

After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?

Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.

I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?

But you didn't do that.

I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.

I thought you were watching him.

That coke was yours, wasn't it?

Kinda.

Dreaming.

Do you got something for me?

I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.

The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.

All your money's in Mexico.

I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.

Who?

I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?

Managers get ten percent.

The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.

I don't like dancing.

Sure.

You live with him.

And your point is?

I'm getting out of here. What do you think?

Are you serious?

Okay.

Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.

I dunno.

C'mon in.

But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.

That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.

Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'

Not now, pick me up.

Uh-huh.

Maybe a minute. She came right out.

Fuck you for asking me that.

Maybe the Feds got it.

Have fun.

Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.

You have cash. What do you need me for?

Cost you a thousand for the bond.

Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.

You think you could do that?

Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.

Yes.

What does she do for you?

You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --

Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?

Is that what I think it is?

I thought you might be asleep.

I have a bond receipt for you to sign.

My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.

Have her bring the money here.

Call her, tell her the combination.

That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.

I know where it is.

He leave town?

Give me his home number.

What are you then?

Then what are you doing here?

What isn't happening?

No, thanks.

Me, too.

Just my luck.

Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.

It's hard to explain.

I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.

There's nothing to expose.

Maybe it's not the army, Jake.

Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?

Ah! I thought you were a mailman.

What the hell is that supposed to mean?

Why do you say that?

How long had that been going on?

How do you know?

I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.

It's good to see you.

I haven't seen her in months.

I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.

I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.

I don't know what to say.

I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.

We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?

Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.

Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.

Don't ask.

Jezzie, I can't see.

They're weird names.

Why do you bring her up?

They're like demons, Jez.

Where are we?

Show me Della!

If I could stop it, I'd stop it.

You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.

Lie down!

Sam, Tony, come in here.

What?

You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.

Let go!

Stay away from me, Jez.

A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.

I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.

Stick with me, kid.

No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.

How many times have you asked me that? How many times?

You've lived with me for two years.

I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.

I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.

Sit down, Jake.

Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.

What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?

You know who I am.

Long time ago.

Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.

The Ladder?

A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.

Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.

They're awfully heavy.

If you're lucky.

Push 'em back.

You come near me and I'll blow us all up.

Last night! They were as real as you are!

Who is?

Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.

I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?

He doesn't like it.

Pour it in.

Yes it does.

He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.

THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.

If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.

And you said high school was boring.

Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.

The hull's imploding!

Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?

I don't know!

Suit up.

Where is he?

Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.

Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.

Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!

Fuckin A...

Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!

I'm pulling, damnit!

I hope so.

Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.

Guys!!! The shuttle?

Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.

400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!

It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?

Not so bad.

You?

I think I had some when I was eight.

She broke my fucking nose!

I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.

I'm thinking Rizzo was right.

She's obviously dealt with this guy before.

We're screwed.

I'm on my way.

Shut up, Thorgan!

Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.

Remember to roll his balls around a bit.

I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.

That ought'a help the situation.

Would you?

You're leaving me here alone?

Oh my God! Adrienne?

Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!

Maybe she tripped.

Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?

Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.

Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.

He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.

Keep trying!

We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.

But...I...400 years?

Scientists. Very intellegent men.

You're crazy!

Sure but what good will that do?

You got it.

You got it.

You got it.

Who's driving the boat?

What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?

You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...

C'mon. Middle appendix --

Full throttle! To port!

He's taken him!

'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.

Do you see the kids?

Like you're from N'Yawk. 

Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?

Michael! Come inside!

I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...

Thank you.

All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.

What kind of a shark did you say it was?

I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...

Maybe we can save August...

Who are you?

No, we just checked the beach...

You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?

Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...

About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.

Rogue?

It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.

What stinks so bad?

Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!

Florida license plate.

Chum?

I want to check something. Hold my feet.

A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...

I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.

Some friends and me took a house.

What else could've done that?

Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!

Is that a boat?

Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.

He's busy.

Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...

Anti-Shark cage.

Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...

It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 

Let it go, don't waste your time.

What do you see?

And I'll drink to yours.

I think I can top that, Mister...

No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---

He's under!

I don't think so.

I'm not hungry, oddly.

Thanks for the message.

Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.

I'm supposed to be running.

I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.

Or something.

Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.

Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.

I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.

What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.

Yeah. That was me.

Also, I think I'm in love with you.

No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.

The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.

I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.

No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?

Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.

I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.

Hon, did you get expelled?

Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.

But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.

Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.

Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.

It really didn't hurt that bad having him.

'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.

You weren't even alive!

I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?

Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?

Commercials.

They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.

You're kidding!

You know... it's parts...

Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.

Hey, I like this.

God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?

You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.

You're something else.

Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.

Come on, I have something for you.

Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.

Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.

What are you?

But you're old!

No thanks. I'm off pills.

Sure.

You found us in the Penny Saver?

Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.

Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.

Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"

I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.

What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?

Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.

Nothing.

No thank you. I'm off sex.

My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...

No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.

Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!

I have no idea what kind of girl I am.

Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?

No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.

Think you can narrow it down for me.

You mean like couples?

Tore up from the floor up?

Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.

Jesus, I didn't say it was.

I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.

It was magnificent, man!

I'm staying pregnant, Le.

Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.

Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!

It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.

No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.

Or stage parents!

Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.

Keith's hot.

Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.

Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.

Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?

Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.

Hm.

She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.

I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.

Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.

Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.

I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.

No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.

Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.

Karma.

He whips you?

Sure.

No it is not!

Early, you are so sweet.

What'll we do out there?

Early, sing me a song.

Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?

Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!

Vernon, Florida.

Turkey mostly.

What do you need a Bible for?

Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.

Ain't you goin' to record it?

Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.

Nah... how much money have you got?

If you say so.

Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.

What happened to Adele?

The party?

It was definitely the high point of the evening.

A book on the warehouse murders?

It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.

I still think we should have met them first.

Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.

Bitch, bitch, bitch!

I heard that.

Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.

Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.

What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!

What are you going to do?

...Brian hurt his foot.

No.

I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?

What is it?

Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.

Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?

Where would we find him?

...That'd be my guess.

Umm. Altogether?

Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.

Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.

To what? Virgins?

What do you mean?

She's probably smash you in the fucking face.

What do you want?

Are you hungry?

What for? That guys a dick.

Yeah, I feel dehydrated.

Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.

Oh. You like her?

Darcy?

I know what you mean.

Why I do what?

Yeah.

Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?

Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.

Yeah.

I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.

Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.

Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.

Nuffin' G. Just forget it.

Hold on.

Is it cold?

You were?

Yeah. I can understand that.

I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.

I like you too.

How do you know?

But I'm scared Telly.

I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.

No, Fidget, I...

You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.

Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.

I wouldn't believe it?

I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?

15.

What?

What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?

I know.

No, I didn't bleed.

Foreplay. Foreplay.

Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.

And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.

That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.

I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.

I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.

Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?

I no understand you. Maybe crazy.

Whah you say? Dissdee?

Yeah.

It's not his fault. He had a hard life.

Oh god. That's horrible.

What?!

He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.

To come?

No.

You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?

What do you want?

Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.

Homesearchers.

Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.

I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.

I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.

Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?

Sanderson?

You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?

He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?

Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!

I haven't got time for this.

Did you know her?

That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.

You're not going to tell me that.

I know what I said!  She looks just like...

Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.

You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?

I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?

If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.

I've figured out the message.

You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.

Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.

You don't understand.

Thanks.

Never mind.  He died two years ago.

--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.

Fuck off!

Why did he what?

Uh huh.

Boys.

Of course.

I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.

Bingo.

That's great.

I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?

Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.

I know that.  I've seen the photo's.

I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?

About a quarter to one.

Ten days ago.

She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.

We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.

Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.

It doesn't make sense.

I went out.

On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.

You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.

Mate in five.

I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?

I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.

Getting too hot in here for you?

Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.

Another kind of game?

Let's change the subject.

Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.

I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.

What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.

You've got to face the things you feel.

Call room service.

What do you want on it?

For emphasis?

I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.

It's not that easy.

It could be anything.

Frank told me.

I got lucky.

Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.

<u>What</u>?

We're not married <u>yet</u>.

Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.

You must move away from the Center.

Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.

Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.

Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.

Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.

The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.

She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.

There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.

He has come for Lyssa.

You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.

He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.

You will tell me her name and we will go together.

Where the spiral begins.

I chose the wrong passage.

Cut. <u>Cut</u>!

You have done it?

Perhaps you think no man would return to me.

I cannot take comfort when she has none.

A forest near the Valley of Needles.

Perhaps he expected to eat it.

He saved our lives.

You and I will guard the fire.

Hah! You don't know me, boy.

You will follow me.

So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.

That I promise you.

We must try to get horses.

Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.

Would you settle for a boar?

Me.  May I eat with you tonight?

A small house.

Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!

Would you desert your friends?

The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.

If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.

No. He will master the leader.

You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.

These walls do not lie! He will betray you.

Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.

Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.

It is important to assure the succession.

I knew.

A match for your son, I think.

Yes. We lost five.

Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?

Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.

No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.

That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.

Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.

That is true.

It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.

Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.

You said nothing. You told me nothing.

Why must you know?

There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.

Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.

No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.

...What?

Huh... 500 meters?

Mathilda?!

...17.

Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.

Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!

...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.

Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!

Nothing, for the moment.

Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!

Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!

...I got lost, Mister.

It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.

Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...

I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.

...And how much is it?

Can I sit on the stairways now?

Messina.

I know... But I'm a little pressed.

Giancarlo... Rinaldi.

You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.

It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.

Maybe later.

What?

Can it kill me?

Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?

Okay.

There was no card.

It's just a regular day.

Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.

Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.

What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.

Show me.

You've just decided, is that right?

Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.

Don't be so sure.

Yes.

If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.

Not our problem.

You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.

That's me.

Umm, Coalville Utah.

Maybe.

Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.

... The Grapes of Wrath.

Saluting.

Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?

He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.

This isn't right.

Water?

Hello.

Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.

I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...

No, I can't have dinner with you.

You OK out there?

I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?

Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.

I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?

What?

Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.

I know that...

That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?

Can we just ignore it?

They wouldn't know.

You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.

One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.

Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?

Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?

A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.

I am lonely, Yuri.

No.

I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.

I can't tell you.

He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.

I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.

You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?

Whatever it is -- it could save you.

How?

Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?

Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?

No, she'd stashed it by then.

I guess.

I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.

Yes.

Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.

Because they got wet.

Tell him, Paulette.

I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!

Thank you.

-- uh --

No!

What's the point?  Look at me.

What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.

Relation?

Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?

You're kidding!

Yes, you are.

Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.

Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!

Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --

Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.

Wow. I'm glad I met you.

My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.

She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...

We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --

It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.

Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.

Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".

I just don't understand what went wrong --

I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.

Absolutely!

I got bangs!

I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!

Maybe she found him like that.

Of course, I do!

Uh -- sure.

Thank you. Having fun?

Thank you.

Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?

I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.

Cunnilingus?

Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!

Yeah, luckily.

I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.

Always.

No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!

I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.

Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.

This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.

Do it now!

Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...

And, now?

Cathay?

I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --

Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.

Gump, is it?

What!

Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?

I fear she's lost.

Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --

Big question that, lad.  Why what?

Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.

If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...

Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.

And who might that be?

Something's coming.

We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.

Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?

Blackheart?

Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.

Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.

We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.

Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.

The chill is worse this night.

It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.

Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.

On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.

Best get down close to the moat, lad.

... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.

Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!

She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...

Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.

They'll do nicely.

If you like.

I may have said perhaps...

Or perchance...

Unicorn?

Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?

That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.

I'll go search for it.

Shhh!

Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.

I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.

My father and the Baron.

Oh, la...

Jack... Forgive me...

That's why he goes masked during the day...

Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.

But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.

Lili... I love you!

Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!

Thought the weather terrible of late.

His feet shall never cross my lips.

I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.

Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...

Is she fair, this princess?

She's dead!

Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.

You'll visit again?

What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.

And am I not fair?

And sweet?

Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.

A faerie's love makes anything possible.

Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...

I think she's about to foal.

Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...

You follow.

I thought I might stop by.

I wanna be with you today.

Since seventh grade.

Here, honey!

Has he eaten anything at all?

Who are all these people?

He seems lonely.

Is that legal?

Monday.

I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.

He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.

What did you think it would be?

I don't know.

Why?

His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.

Does everything have to have a point?

He's got a standing invitation.

I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.

From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.

We've known each other since grade school.

A violation?

I'm not.

Maybe that's too long.

Yes, it is.

I'm sorry.

Not a shower.

It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?

He escaped.  He's going back in.

There are no windows facing my...exposure.

You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.

No I'm not!

You'll know me by the time we're through.

I'll get your bag.

Goodnight.

I warned you yesterday.

I don't know.

A friend of yours is here.

I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.

The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...

I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.

How do you become something you're not?

Nothing.

What do you know about me?

Getting high, I guess.

Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.

I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.

That's so weird...

What's wrong with your back?

The kind where there isn't really an answer.

Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!

Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.

Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.

I need you to do me a favor.

You let him pierce his nose?

He doesn't answer.

Why does he have a lock on his door?

But you can't call me while you think?

Why would they tow your truck?

How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...

He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.

I can't leave the house?

Well, for later then.

You're not well.

I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.

This was my very first slow dance.

Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.

What did I say?

You bit my finger.

Left you?

So could I.

Don't even...I'm there.

Sooner than the Fall.

Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.

You can't go because of Sam?

I know.

What are you doing home?

Sam took them to a movie.

Are you wearing eye shadow?

Either do you.

No.

Okay.

I didn't go in your room.

What did you say?

Someone stop her!

Yes, it is.

Dad's home, already?

We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.

But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?

Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.

I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.

Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.

That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.

Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.

Yes, sir.

Sure, boss.

You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.

Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.

Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.

That's because I've never been here before.

I know it begins with a "C"...

I don't think so.

Good old Monroe.

Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.

Why didn't you take it?

Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?

There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.

Here I am.

So you made a generous contribution.

Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?

No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.

Forget it.

Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?

We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?

Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.

You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?

At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.

New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?

He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!

Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.

Whatever.

Make 'em throw strikes.

I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.

That was five years ago.

He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.

Don't touch that car.

You ain't getting out of that trunk.

And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.

I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.

We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.

That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.

Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.

So?

I'm sorry, he's on medication...

State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!

Move it out.

Hey, Ray...

C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.

I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.

What were they, bootleggers?

Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.

I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.

I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.

I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.

If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.

Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?

Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.

Are you offering me a bribe?

Like you shot Winston Hancock?

Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.

You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.

That's a long story...

I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.

All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.

Understood.

Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.

No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.

Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?

Don't do it!

Noon...

Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.

My mom wasn't a goat?

Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.

I can't screw.  I can't screw.

I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.

I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...

I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.

The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.

Look. You were really high. Things happen.

Sure, pop. Whatever you want.

This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!

Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!

Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.

Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?

Son, just do your best.

What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...

Beast.

I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.

Of course you do, Tommy Tune.

Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.

Oh, that's terrible, Reege...

Dude, it's us. Let us in.

You smell like coconuts.

Andrew.

I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?

Why are you laughing?

It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.

What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?

Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?

Are you dead?

East Rutherford.

Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?

Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?

I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?

I don't know?

No, for you! How old are you, Billy?

Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.

Only a few? You're just not trying.

Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?

You? Why? You're already beautiful.

Did you?

I'm fine...  See you...

I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.

Please... No.

No.  Just no.

He was killed.

But I wasn't sure you'd come.

Then it's still no.

You know something.

Both... running's what I'm interested in.

And I never heard of Sanctuary.

That's tomorrow.

Maybe you'll think of something...

That's nice.

Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.

Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?

Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain

It doesn't make any difference anymore.

I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.

It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.

Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?

Of course.

You want there to be one... that doesn't...

He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.

To what?

No.

What's that?

At least it's over...

We'll remember. But that's a long time off...

Oh, my...

A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?

For as long as I can remember.

I have always been here...

What makes you think so?

Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?

No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.

Never, never, ever. Nothing.

Oh my... I'll try.

No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.

I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --

Too little.

No, I'm okay.

Yes, I thought my wife...

Maid? Relative?

Right... This just glided along.

Or something.

I don't know.

Me, too.

Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.

Are you positive he knows?

I used to.

No, honey... It was part of the deal.

He works for Mr. Eddy.

He makes films for Mr. Eddy.

Yeah.

Okay...

Alice, I...

Up the stairs - down the hall.

I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.

He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?

The night before you showed up in the slammer...

Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.

All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.

You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.

I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.

No, sir, it's not.

Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.

SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.

No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.

No, no. I want to go in.

What are you going to do?

I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.

Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.

I guess so.

Thanks, guys.

Why would anyone do something like this?

Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.

Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?

Okay... Lemme clear it with...

I can see that.

Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.

It'll be ready.

What?

Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?

Yeah.

At your house. Don't you remember?

Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.

Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".

I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.

Come on.

Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."

A paleontologist.

Well, what do you know about that!

Uh-huh.

You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.

Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!

Good morning

Oh, really?

Will you stop squawking!

I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.

As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.

It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!

You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.

Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village

Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.

No.

Look, Bob!

Well - I'm

Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business

Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?

Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .

Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.

The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.

Shall we have another?

Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!

You've very kind Mr. Lovett.

Why, no.

I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?

Thank you.

No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.

Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as

What is it, my son?

Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.

That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?

Oh, the girl at the piano?

I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.

Mine?

Do you think this will come in my time?

Dead?

You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.

Chang's first question was about the pilot.

Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.

George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.

Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.

Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.

She's going with me.

What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?

Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!

All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.

Bump?

Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.

Why?

I'd love it!

I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!

I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.

Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.

English!

Go? Where?

Yes.  Barney!

Please don't go.

And Goodwill Toward Man?

They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.

No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.

Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.

His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry

All the time, sir.

Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?

Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.

Kay...

What?

This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.

Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.

If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.

You don't know the half of it.

Something seem unusual to you about that?

Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?

Gee.  You really think?

Where to?

All of it?

I'd double it and add 20.

Do his job.

Kay!?

Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?

Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.

Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.

With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?

I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.

No.

I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?

Nope.  Nothing at all.

How'd you know that?  Kay?

Will it lower the curve?

The what?

Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.

Wait-- listen--

What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?

Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?

Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.

I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.

Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.

And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...

They're inside.

Agatha...

What is it?

Why?

Agatha, you're never going back there.

How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?

That's comforting.

Drowning.

Yes, sir.

I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.

He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.

What?

We won't let them.

Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?

How could Witwer have accessed the case file?

John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?

I'm not getting halo'd.

No doubt.

The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...

Everybody runs.

You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.

Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?

Sir?

We're in motion on something.

Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.

Yes, it is.

Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.

The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.

Just a nickname.

What does he think of your chosen line of work?

Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?

You gotta have faith, Dad.

I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.

Good-bye, Dad...

I'm your son.  I'm you.

NO!

No.

I'm asking you again, who made you do this?

What the fuck is going on?

Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!

The what?

You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.

And how did Lamar become involved?

Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.

Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.

I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.

But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.

Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.

The female.

Nothing.  I didn't kill him.

I thought you were retiring?

We know why John was tagged.

No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.

Thank you.  This is Burgess.

Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...

Not quite.

How?

We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...

Yes.

Shhh.  You know what I hear?

Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.

That's the Red Ball Alarm.

Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.

Two?

How many?

Who?

I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.

Yes.

Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?

I don't have any cream.  Sorry.

We used to, every summer.

Have you been there recently?

He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.

What does he want with a precog?

They were grabbing her fucking ass --

When served warm --

What's 'incidentals?'

Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.

Yeah. Take it.

Is it the good room?

See you later.

Holy shit.

We used to take baths together.

Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.

Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?

Where were you?

The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.

If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.

The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.

Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.

Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.

Yeah? You sure?

Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.

Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --

Yeah. Where is he?

Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.

No.

And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.

Ricky's taken care of.

This one?

She was fast, huh?

Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.

I'll work it off.

I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --

Yeah.

What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.

He'll work it off.

You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.

Not you. I want Ricky to answer.

You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?

Well, this is the corner.

Ruiz isn't here.

Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.

Don't be shitty.

Don't be shitty.

I'm not gonna bring it up to him.

I got no idea.

No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.

Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.

Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.

C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.

Pretty nice.

I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.

Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.

How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.

Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?

We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.

As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?

They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.

Nothing.

What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?

You would think.

You too?

Back in.

What's up?

Where?

Did you hear what he just said?

I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him

You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?

Why?

They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...

I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?

What?

The videos.

Yes.

Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.

Watch it...

Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.

I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.

Here...

You're from LA, right?

You'll love it.

Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.

So tell me how it is.

Yes, sir.

Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?

She poured it for --

Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?

Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.

That's none of your fucking business.

And where might that be?

Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.

Who's up for a night on the town.

He had it coming.

When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.

No, my mama. She's from Grenada.

Nnnnnnn!

Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?

Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.

Now.

That really you, Red?

Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --

Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.

That's what Mama used to say.

Look 'em up and and out what they mean.

Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --

Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?

The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.

No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?

Who are you?

For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --

Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.

No, Brother Minister.

She ate.

That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --

How do you like it?

Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.

Yes.

What do you think?

Because you're in trouble.

We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.

Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?

Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.

Is that what this is about? Material wealth?

The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.

Betty it's me. It's me.

Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.

I told you we don't know for certain.

Please, go ahead.

If she got eyes, she do.

Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.

Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.

Now you come back.

Murder.

You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.

Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.

Please make way, please --

What does Sidney say?

I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.

And don't come back.

...That isn't a whore?

Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.

Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.

The hell you are.

The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.

Might be all right.

That's right.

I'm the man.

Brothers of Brother Johnson.

Allah will provide.

What do you want?

I'm not... easy.

Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.

[I have a friend there.]

I guess that makes you the smart one.

I show, you give me the information?

[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]

[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]

[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]

[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]

[Who are you?]

[It's non-negotiable.]

[I told you, non-negotiable.]

[I want you.]

[Lucky how?]

[O.K. So tell me more.]

[That's what everybody keeps saying.]

Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.

Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.

Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.

I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.

Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]

The United States.

Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.

Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.

My ankle.

It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.

You need to practice.

No, that was in Columbia.

I know you're not.

Still not a question.

So are you.

No.

Planned what?

Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.

Do you know what she told me last night?

[No. Why?]

I'm trying, mom.

We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.

You do?

Our daughter.

Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?

What? Who?

[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]

[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]

[You only give information so you can fuck me.]

I already ate.

That's what friends do.

I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.

You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.

All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.

I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?

Oh, yeah.

There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.

Where?

I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.

She musta kept you inna shadows all night.

I feel fine.

That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.

Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?

Well, it ain't your baby.

Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.

I don't.

I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.

I really should get home...

No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.

I just wanna kiss, that's all.

I'll wait for your call.

Okay.

It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.

Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.

I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.

Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...

That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.

Sure, great if you ain't married.

Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.

Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?

What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!

You gotta good heart.

Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.

I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.

You gonna get married.

Marty...

Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.

I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.

I heard you, Ma.

What, Ma?

She didn't look Italian to me.

You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.

Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.

Hey, Ang'...

Hiya, Ralph...

Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...

Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.

Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...

Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.

Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.

Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...

Sure, sure.

We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.

Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.

I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...

How you, Radar?

Home.

There's only one way.

No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.

Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.

When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.

Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!

I done my shopping in Seoul last night.

This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.

A native is someone who is born in a particular place.

Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.

Same here. You can retire my number.

Be right with you.

Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.

No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.

And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.

Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?

A football game?

N-n-no thanks, G-General.

You willing to b-back that up with odds?

Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.

Right.

We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.

Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.

And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.

Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.

Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?

Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.

Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!

We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.

Oh, Jesus.

I don't get it.

They're coming.

We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.

He can move in here with us.

Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.

We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.

It's possible

For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...

You're leaving tomorrow?

Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.

A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.

It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.

Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.

Why would he do that?

Excuse me, Sergeant.

Homosexuality.

Just in dreams?

Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.

Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.

If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.

They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.

But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.

That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?

I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!

It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.

I did. First and only blow. So far.

I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.

Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...

Morning, Captain.

Damn.

Good morning.

It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.

Um-hum.

John Doe, the one in the speech.

You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.

Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?

Me?

Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.

Yeah, that's the one.

Thirty dollars.

Oh, I'm sure I can.

How do you do.

All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.

Your purse. I need ten dollars.

Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.

Oh!

So?

The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!

That's all, Ned. Thank you.

Plus a bonus.

Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.

Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.

Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.

I ain't seen him for a week.

Oh, let me go, will you!

Where is she?

Did you find her?

Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.

The heelots!

Sure. Mostly often.

I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.

What Bert's trying to say iswellwe need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.

A gag. A gag!

I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!

Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!

Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?

Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!

You betcha.

No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.

Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.

Did you write itor didn't you?

There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand I hope they do it!

I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.

I think it must have been a sea- gull.

We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.

"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.

Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?

You want me to go up with you?

It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.

I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.

Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.

Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?

Am I gettin' the car?

Automatic.

I what?

Wait a minute, lemme see that.

Being faxed over now.

Is that all?

What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?

You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.

National Marksman Competition.

We could fill it with water.

I don't really like to drink.

Well, if I have to, I have to.

Do you really?

No.

I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.

I'm not good at lying.

I do.

Fine.

That's okay. That's his style.

To run late!

Damnit!

Pull up alongside.

Good question.

Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.

I ain't interested in your life story.

Doing what? Cleaning toilets?

Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?

I'm not drunk. Yet.

You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.

You got a bet on the game tonight?

Yeah that's it.

Scottie...

It's very nice.

Scottie...

Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.

Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.

He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.

Define concern.

Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?

Okay, I think I could swing that.

Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.

What happened to your Trans Am?

Who's running it!

Yes.

-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?

No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.

About what?

Yes.

That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.

True.  But why?

-- Two million people plugged-in here.

Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.

New York.

-- Yes.

He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!

Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.

The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.

Insurance.

Cleaning up a mess.

No.

-- You told me.

Her?

Once they digitized you, they added it.

Way you kiss me.

Not you.  A copy.

Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.

Because you'll never believe me.

Activated.

Resurrection.

If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!

Ah... sure.

Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!

I've never been this sore in my life.

Activating Power Beam!

Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!

Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.

... I just pray we're not too late.

Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!

Where did it originate?

I am the crane, agile and sublime!

NINJA WOLF ZORD!

This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!

We can take these guys!

Ryan's Comet!!

Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.

A real shame.

BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!

You want me to place a few calls?

GO IVAN!!

You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--

So they've been destroyed?

We couldn't have done it better ourselves.

Activating Power Scope!

LET'S DO IT!?

I ain't no fuckin' kike!

Charlie Luciano.

Poor, yeah.

Not another word.

You scare me, Charlie.

Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.

Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.

An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.

He was around...

But if ya can't catch the guys...

Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.

Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?

No. I'm here with you.

I must be going.

I'm doin' business here!

It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.

As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.

So what is the problem?

Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.

And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.

Might as well put the time to use.

The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.

Who?

I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.

Never threaten me, Boss.

So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.

Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?

I know about you.

Didn't know you felt that way.

A mother-fuckin' peace conference.

But that's an hour's drive.

You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.

Don, I'd be honored.

He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.

Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?

I'll take care of the Boss.

No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.

I turned him down flat.

Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.

Jesus.

Anything!

Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.

I don't know. I guess it was...

Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?

Olive. - Where exactly am I?

Stu Miley.

Well - you'd need a body.

I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!

Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?

Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?

Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.

Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.

Monkeybone...!?

Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.

Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.

Who?

My <u>tail</u> itches.

The ring...

This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.

Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.

Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.

Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.

I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?

Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.

Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.

Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.

No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.

Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?

Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.

What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?

Well, I'd love to see inside your club.

Well, once you're inside, it's nice.

Uh-huh?

Aaron?

I can make my own decisions.

Mm hmm.

Goodbye, sweetheart.

It's Marika.  Is Paula there?

Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.

Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.

Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.

Moscow.

This way?

Forty-five all total.

It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!

I did not--

Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.

Let's send out a pigeon!

That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.

I would cherish you--and stay sober.

Whadaya mean--*right*?

Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 

I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--

He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--

Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--

Do we *have* to?

I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!

Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!

Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--

Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--

He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--

I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--

Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--

Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?

This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--

I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!

Is *what* getting me down?

Oh, a *boy*!

Than what?

Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?

Why, of course.

Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!

Look! There it is!

Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...

No.

Here--where are you running off to?

Will he *yield*?

Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--

I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?

The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!

Mr. President--

I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!

And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--

Office of--Senator Smith?

You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.

You *couldn't*?

Punch?

Right.

Committee, huh?

What's that?

Try sitting down.

Uh--getting back to this, Senator--

Go right ahead.

No!

In Terry Canyon?

Must have been tickled pink.

Second drawer.

Saunders--

Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?

Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--

Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!

Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--

Wonderful!

Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.

Goodnight, Senator--

And how's your bill, Senator?

Well--I--

You're not going to take your *suit* off!

The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!

Ring the call to quorum.

A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?

Well--I can *manage*--

How'd you like a punch in the nose?

What do you mean? What's going on?

Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.

Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--

Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.

Go away, Nosey.

You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--

You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.

I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--

Yes--

How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?

Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?

Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.

Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!

Senator Paine.

It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--

Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!

Page boys!

Sometimes he whistles.

Thank you very much.

No! I resigned last week!

Yes!!!

Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .

Really?

Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.

Oh. What's happening about the opera?

Yes.

Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.

What's that?

Oh, that

I'm from a small town too, you know.

You have?

He did? I play the tuba

Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.

No, I don't mind.

Oh, hello darling.

He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?

Hello.

With pay!

Have lunch.

It took some high-powered acting, believe me.

I tell you that dame's nuts.

Hurry up!

Yes, sir.

Oh, yes sir.

Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.

Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.

Better wire him right away, John.

Wants to know who the heir is.

Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney

Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.

Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N

Yeah?

How do you do.

What for?

Oh, I wasn't worried about that.

That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?

No, thanks.

I don't think we've got any suitcases.

Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."

Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.

Arthur wants to quit!

He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.

That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?

Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?

What? There must be 2000 of them out there.

Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.

We own an opera house, don't we?

I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?

Because it just isn't a business, that's all!

Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.

Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!

A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!

That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.

A child? My uncle's?

One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?

No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.

Yes?

Take the stand!

Not at all.

Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.

I write poetry.

Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.

Christian Svenson.

Yes, ma'am.

South Dakota north.

South Dakota - but on the top.

Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.

Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.

Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.

That was something I was never able to find out, sir.

What's that?

Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.

Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!

No!  What do you want!!

Me more than most.

You must have been concerned.

I'm fine.

It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.

Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.

How do you mean?

And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.

Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.

Go to hell.

Now we're back on track.

What exactly is it supposed to do?

-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --

My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.

I've had my moments.

Tastes good.

What do you think's wrong with her?

I do.

Yes, your honor.

No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.

It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.

It's a pretty piece of land.

Horror show. What'd you do tonight?

Why do you watch?

...so accomplished.

Okay.

See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.

Don't need it.

I'm trying.

Why don't you tell me?

Good evening, Mrs. Cook.

Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.

I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.

Uh-huh.

Where?

So the headaches may not even be a part of this?

Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.

Disgusting.

Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.

Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.

That's one way to put it.

Um-huh.

I'm glad.

Okay...

Which show was that?

What?

I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.

You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?

What do you want me to see?

Do you think that's what he wants?

Nah... scotch.

Of course! That's exactly what I want.

I understand.

Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.

Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?

Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?

This --

Yep.

It's not?

Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.

Holy shit!

"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?

There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.

Wow.

Yes, yes it does...

I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.

Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?

They are evil, cursed, they matter not.

And then killing your sister.

In the desert? What for?

Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.

Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.

Oh yes, always.

Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?

You will not believe it.

-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.

Water turning to blood.

Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.

To be hanged.

I would never!

Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.

Who cares? I don't see no treasure.

No.

No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.

I just decked your brother

Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.

What are those mirrors for?

Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?

Who was talking about what?

Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself

We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.

There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!

What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.

Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?

Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.

I was mistaken.

After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.

And it stinks to high heaven in here.

We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.

Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?

What?

You have got to be joking?

I know you did.

Really?

That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.

Your mind is so slippery.

Fantasizing... about you.

Darling, you've got the wrong idea.

So who killed him?

The Inscrutable Six?

I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.

You're nuts.

Frankenstein!

Really?

Alone tonight?

It is?

Roy.

What have they got that we ain't got?

Yes.

I just know.

We had an off night, that's all.

But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...

He's got the fact that he's Superman!

Because that's what it is.

But I just don't feel it.

What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!

Like what? Cutting off my own ear?

Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!

Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!

Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?

No.

This looks like a job for Superman --

And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.

I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.

Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?

General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.

For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.

I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?

I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.

I think it's absolutely charming.

Whatever suggested the idea to you?

I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.

You could have them here by daybreak.

Properly arranged, yes.

It is a terrible shock.

Come back in an hour.

Let me see it.

Yes, sir.

A glass of champagne, please.

Ajaccio.

I see...

Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.

What is that?

Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?

Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?

No, sir.

You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.

I very much doubt that he will.

I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.

Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.

One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?

You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?

You must not act impetuously.

But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.

I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.

Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.

Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.

Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.

I thought I was.  I was confused.

One had better legs.

Open the door.  It's me.

Yes.

Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.

I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.

That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?

Yes.

Yes, of course.  What do you want?

My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.

Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.

You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.

I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.

Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.

Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.

Does she deserve anything better?

My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.

No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.

Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.

A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.

That's it?

You paid cash?

I'll do it.

You know what he mean, dude.

That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.

Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.

Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?

If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!

I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.

I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.

Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.

I know, be still.

I can't taste nothing.

Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!

Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.

Yeah, that's why I walked down here.

I don't know yet.

Sorry about today, man.

What's the B-G's?

Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.

It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.

What are you doing here?

Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.

It's locked.

So what?  Let's make'em wait.

Okay.

I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!

It's alright.

Have you seen Day-Day?

Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!

Negative...they vamped.

Let it go, Roach, trust me.

Let it go!

He's a boy, dude.

Call me.

Nothing.

Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.

I don't know the number.

Keep pushing.

I got my mase.

The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.

What's the matter?

Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.

Elroy.

Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.

Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.

Oh, yeah?

One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.

I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.

I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.

Don't worry. She's good with kids.

Yes, I'm listening.

Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.

Where did you get these? Who are you?

It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.

Then I have time for a drink.

Me?

Tell me why he's dead.

That's not my problem, Mr. Watson

That's right. That gives you...

Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.

I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.

I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.

Nods.

Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.

I promise.

I'm just an accountant.

I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.

What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.

I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...

What?

Yeah.

I don't know.

I don't want my windshield cleaned.

No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.

You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?

You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!

No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.

Laughs.

Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.

You're a big girl, huh?

It better be.

Help me get her off the rug.

Shut up.

You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.

Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?

Do it!

Yeah.

What gives?

He carried on some; kicked.

What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?

You have all sinned!

Yes! Yes!

Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.

How do you mean?

Walt!

She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --

Now ain't you relieved, Walt?

Tricked us!

John don't like him much.

There's something else.

'Cause you're too little.

John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!

Yes, I reckon that's it.

Somewheres. I don't know yet.

That's Daddy!

Up river.

About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.

I mind you said there was two.

It -- she --

I'll tell.

You could save him, little bird.

Come to me, boy!

Tell me another secret about my Dad.

No. No one never did.

I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.

Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.

Yes.

Where's she at?

Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!

None of your business, Madam.

Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?

Thank God.

No.

Hi.

You do?

Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.

Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.

If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.

What?

Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.

Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.

I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?

Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?

Uh, she just saw you, sir...

How you know that?

Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.

School.

Right home after. See you.

I won't.

So he's alive?

I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.

I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...

He's nuts about you.

No more fights.

Have you any money?

It's from Paris.

From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?

Good evening, Ninotchka.

No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.

An omelet.

Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.

You should be more careful, Anna.

Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.

Tell me... what else did you have?

They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.

Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.

All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.

I can tell you exactly.

If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.

...des raisins de Madère, des framboises... 

What is it?

Which part of the room is mine?

Don't worry... there will be enough.

With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.

Good evening, Monsieur.

Eight forty-two, sir.

You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.

Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.

Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.

Are they indeed? Thank you.

That's perfect!

Thank you, Louis.

Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?

Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?

We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.

...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.

No, no.

Comrade.

Just three people in a room this size? Whew!

Look for yourselves.

Monsieur.

Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.

Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?

Yes, Comrade.

The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.

I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.

Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 

Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!

Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?

Me?

What?

I don't have to but I find it natural.

I'll try.

Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.

Go ahead.

Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.

We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?

Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.

Oh, I see. What do you use instead?

It's false sentimentality.

Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...

Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...

Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.

I don't like your following me.

This is a place for workmen.

Why?

Why?

Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.

So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!

I don't think so.

Yes.

Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.

That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"

You must, darling.

You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.

Darling, darling... please!

No! No!

Yes... a kiss... salute!

No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?

Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...

Who cried that one?

Yes, sweetheart. 

Good morning, Swana.

Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!

A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.

Oh, yes.

What does he say?

It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!

I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!

Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.

Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.

Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.

Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.

I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?

A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?

No thanks, Swana.

I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?

Do you expect me to believe that?

Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.

Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.

What?

Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.

If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.

If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?

It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.

I must insist that you leave.

In that case I can only say good-by.

Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?

I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.

Go on.

That's no business... that's a social injustice.

May I ask what has happened?

It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.

This will do. 

Raw carrots and beets.

Where do you eat?

Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.

No, we have nothing to hide.

Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.

You do it.

'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.

I figured that out.

Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.

Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.

He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.

Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...

Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?

No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.

I thought the gloves were off.

Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.

The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.

How do you see this?

That's right ...

What's Liddy got?

It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.

We were working on China.

No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.

That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?

Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?

Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?

He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.

Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.

Jesus!

They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.

Money.  Follow the money.

These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.

No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?

What?

Sir?

My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?

Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!

It's Helms -- it's got to be.

How?

What about the documents he promised?

Is it my turn?

What about happiness, Mother?

Harold ... can I get you anything?

Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.

I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.

Yes.

Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.

It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.

You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?

It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?

Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.

Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.

No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.

We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.

Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.

"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.

We'll see about that.

She's quite pretty.

... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.

Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.

Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.

I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...

You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?

Free, if you're the president.

Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...

... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?

But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.

Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.

You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.

My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.

It broke my heart when Harold died.

That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...

Hello ...

Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...

I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.

Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.

Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.

Sir?

Sir?

Well, we could delete it.

I know ...

What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.

You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?

I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.

I want a divorce.

That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.

Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?

Are you serious?

Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?

Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.

They were for me.  They're mine.

Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.

The "crises"?

Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?

Who else'd be in your truck.

Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.

'Predate it.

In Angola. Yeah.

I don't know. I feel overmatched.

Try "old" on for size.

You ain't heard from him?

It's not me he's in trouble with.

Some pretty bad people.

Llewelyn Moss?

Gun out and up.

Believe you're right.

No sir.

No sir.

Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?

That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?

He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.

You want me to wait til you've quit the building?

It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.

Lord no. I'm not retired.

Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.

I didn't see my Prednizone.

Well I didn't see it.

To your husband.

Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.

You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.

Just keep it up.

That'll work.

Well -- how come?

C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.

Things happened. I can't take 'em back.

Uh-huh.

Is Llewelyn there?

I need you to step out of the car, sir.

In the truck.  I'll get it.

I seen you was from Dallas.

What time do you close?

I don't know. I couldn't say.

No.

Never mind.  I want a tent.

The kind with the most poles.

If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.

You want to change rooms?

I got beers in my room.

I'm retired.

Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.

Yeah. I was in Nam.

He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.

No I don't have it.

If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?

No sir.

It's fine. Mind your own meal...

They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?

Oww! My arm, careful!

I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...

No, Elden, I need to...

...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...

Anyway, so what?

So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.

I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.

We think we know where Betty is.

I know that...

What about it?

I know plenty.

Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!

Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.

Umm, I don't think that...

I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.

Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...

WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!

I better go check on them.

...what're you saying?

I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...

Yes, ma'am.

Umm... yes. Back home.

Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.

Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.

No, Del.

I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.

I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?

She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?

...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...

Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.

Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...

...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...

What?

Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?

I don't know.

I begged him to let me put that on!

Los Angeles, California.

Did you love it?

Really?

He has a wife?!

You said in L.A., anything goes.

Shhh! I heard you the first time.

Fine.

To a party in the Hollywood Hills.

Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.

No, almost never.

No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...

Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?

Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?

I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.

There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...

Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.

Are you kidding me? What's to like?

Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?

So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?

Hell of a way to die.

IT SURE IS!!

You told me how to do it!

Well, why'd you shoot him?

...that's a good motto.

Should I kill him now?

...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.

You think so? Joyce says she's timid.

Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!

They paid us half. They still owe us half...

Worse... you're in Texas.

I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...

No.

Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.

What?

Well... I think I saw her soul.

You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...

I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...

It just didn't fit her profile...

Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.

Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.

Oh, five years, give or take.

No, wait... what happened next, Betty?

Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...

We know that...

No! Let me try this!

Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.

What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...

Yeah. Why, you know him?

Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?

She's a lesbian.

I swear to God!

No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...

I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...

Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?

You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.

Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -

Gopher, Everett?

That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.

Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.

Four hundred, Delmar.

Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!

Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!

I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.

I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.

Assa good idea, Pappy.

Campaign manager? Waldrip.

Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.

Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.

Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.

Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.

Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.

I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!

...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!

Well, we need that ring.

Well sure, honey, but...

What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?

Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!

Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...

I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.

Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.

Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.

We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.

You got a maiden name, Daddy?

What for?

I never said any of that!

Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.

No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.

I'm doing okay, sir.

Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!

That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?

Pity you don't have the character.

Not a fucking chance, asshole!

Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!

Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.

Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.

I didn't call you anything before that.

No, sir.

Zack, don't!

Yes, sir!

What are you tired from?

But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --

Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.

He was. He died.

Yeah.

Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.

That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!

Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.

Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'

No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.

No way... Would you?

Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?

Really?

Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?

No, and I'm not looking for one either.

Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.

Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!

What's stopping you?

Does it still hurt?

Are those for me?

Why'd he do it?

Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!

I bet you do!

Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.

I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.

Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.

No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.

Peace out.

God.

Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.

Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.

Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.

Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.

It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.

The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.

FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!

Keep your voice down.

Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.

A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?

I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.

Different tables.

Shut up and let me think.

She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.

We're trying to scare them, not kill them!

Shit!

Hey.

Adios.

No ball, kid.

Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.

Open it.

If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --

He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.

Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...

What?

Why?

The furniture guy?

Open the door.

Don't.

They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.

Say fuck.

"Get the fuck out of my house."

Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.

On it!

Uh uh.

I'm dizzy, not deaf.

What if I keep dropping?

Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?

Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.

Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?

I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.

Yeah.

I got you.

Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."

Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!

Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.

Man, fuck you!!!

I don't know. Look around man.

Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.

Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.

No man. PE -- "political education."

It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.

Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...

I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.

Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?

So talk...

A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.

Yeah... let me think about it.

I'm down.

Right on Brother Judge...

You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...

Brimmer.

Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?

Well, act like it. Come on.

And who is we?

Maybe...

S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.

No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...

Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.

Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.

All of the above, man...  And then some.

Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...

I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.

You don't look alright.

Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.

Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.

Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...

I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...

That would be nice.

I expect to try.

It worked.  How many men can you raise?

His journals, letters, maps, books...

You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.

Pride will do.

He's my father.

Thank you.

Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.

Goodbye.

Colonel will do.

Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.

And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?

They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.

Perhaps.

Probably.

Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.

The middle colonies?

Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.

Yes...  ... father.

Flanking riders?

She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.

Granted.  Where are you going?

That's right.

Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.

Go on.

He left us.

Name five hundred.

Gabriel.

Thank you.

Long time.

How many men have we seen die?

We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.

I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.

He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?

Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?

Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.

But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?

In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.

Ellie...Ellie...what...

I will. Come and kiss me.

I know.

No more chocolate chip cookies.

I swear.

Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?

Not at all.

Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.

Allman Brothers.

I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.

For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?

Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.

Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?

Why? For God's sake, why?

No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.

No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.

A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.

The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.

Come on--let's parole 'em.

I just said--

Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.

Yes, I guess I do.

You can't.  I can.

Elizabeth goes free!

You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.

Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.

All right then.

Men!  Are you up for it?

Aye, for us there is.

By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!

I want you to leave.  And never come back.

Then why aren't you eating?

What?

I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.

-- but that was not a proper kiss.

Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.

A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!

You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.

To the Black Pearl.

Nor did you, I noticed.

I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.

Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.

How did he get off the island?

We're not going to just surrender!

Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.

As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!

Smith.

We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.

You threatened Miss Swann.

'Bootstrap?'

My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.

Oh -- did I forget to mention that?

These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --

The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.

... No.

If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.

Mentioned it, is more what he did.

My apologies, Governor.

No.  She hasn't.

Bleak.  Very bleak.

You got it, Dr. Argon.

Have you found Dr. Bright?

Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.

No, thank you.

How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?

You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.

Maybe you should, but you can't.

Ain't it.

The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!

Nebbleman.

You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.

Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.

She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.

I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.

The nanobot is gone.

Shut up and do it!

Thank you, sir.

Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?

I want Trix!  Mommy!

So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.

A man?

What did he want?

Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?

This day just keeps going from bad to worse.

What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.

Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.

Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.

Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.

Who isn't?

Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.

So, I guess it worked.

I guess I should be flattered.

Yeah, we'll see.

We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.

Susan, this is the future of America here.

It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.

Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.

Daniel!

We don't?

The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.

Three days ago it was.

But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!

I don't know.

I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.

You didn't think I could just leave you?

Did you think I could just leave you...?

We were different people then.

Oh yes you are!

The question is, are you?

Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?

Don't worry, four eyes.

To make a gentleman out of a tramp?

I think you should, Miss Gallagher.

Certainly. Right over there.

No - give you another guess.

For what?

Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?

Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.

Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.

Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!

Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?

That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.

You can't walk out of here like this.

That's ridiculous.

You're acting like a child.

Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher

It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.

I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.

Oh, man!

Is that so?

I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.

Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.

All right, all right, don't mention it.

I certainly will.

Oh boy, I'd love it.

Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.

Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.

Well - it's only April.

Yes, sir.

Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!

A what?

Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.

Sure.

I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.

Dawson, sir.

Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.

Quite so. Quite.

I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.

Yes, of course. I'll get it for you

Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?

Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.

Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.

I hope you'll be very happy.

Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.

Not since you broke into society.

Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.

Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?

Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.

I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?

Must be my wife.

Right!

Yes - and I'd love it.

Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.

Right.

Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...

Very good.

Grayson - Anne's lawyer.

Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.

The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.

Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.

I have it here.

Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.

You quit trying to stop anybody

Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.

You don't.

The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.

"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"

I have. Double-strength!

About what? Your marriage to Anne!

Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.

Yes, sir.

Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?

Yes, sir.

How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?

Very good, sir.

We're in Pleasantville?

In my handbag.

No ... They won't be able to tell.

What?

Thanks ... I love you.

Bud brought it to me.

I've got to go ...

Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...

Um ... It's ...

Gosh. I hardly know what to say.

Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?

It is?

Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.

Oh, no thanks ...

I'm fine--but thank you.

One of those ... big beds?

Rain.

You're not allowed to lie.

Why am I out of order?

Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.

Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.

What are you doing?

No way.

Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.

Get lost!

What happened?

You--you gotta get us out of here.

We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.

I don't think so.

It's in your closet.

They don't notice that kind of thing.

Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.

Really? It seems so fattening.

Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.

... Yeah.

Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...

Oh ... Right.

Do they have those ... Where you come from?

You don't know?

What?

Yeah.

Sure ...

Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?

Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.

Yeah ... Sort of ...

Right. And how did she dress him?

Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.

Because we don't belong!

But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.

Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?

It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?

Why?

I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.

Why?

Why don't you just take me back without it?

Just gimme the damn remote!

I'm going on trial tomorrow?

Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.

... Yeah.

Yes.

What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!

Forget about that!

No, that's not it.

Just a little--You know.

What's the rush?

That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.

Yeah ... Saw you too.

Yeah. 

So you can't talk to me?

You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.

This is "Fly With Us?"

I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.

There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.

Why?

She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.

I'm not, I'm very happy.

I don't know.

I feel really on the spot now.

I don't know.

OH MY GOD. Look at that.

....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?

Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?

You don't even know how much it is.

Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?

I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....

I don't have a girlfriend --

This is....illegal....I'll call the police.

You think it's ok where I left it, right there?

Ok.

No. Not at all. It's nice.

Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.

Ok.

It's Barry.

...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --

Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?

Yeah?

Yeah.

I thought you said you bought all that pudding --

Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?

Nothing.

...yeah...

Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....

What do you mean?

Yes.

yeah.

What's that? What is that that you're doing?

I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --

Can I come home with you when we get there?

What is this?

You left me at the hospital.

You can't do that.

If they break or something. What is it, plastic?

For what?

Why? ...what?

Hello, how are you?

It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.

337.....I'm sorry....

337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.

I just don't want anyone to know it's me.

Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --

You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --

I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?

Like a psychiatrist?

You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?

That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.

Yes I'm fine.

Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?

I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....

Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?

Wait a minute --

What do you have in the house?

This is a bunch of bullshit.

What time are you gonna be there?

You can't just stay in your house.

Yeah but I'm serious.

Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --

It's fine.

He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --

Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?

He did seem a little strange.

Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.

We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --

He's a writer, not a madman.

I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.

For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?

"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."

"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."

Not now, or we're both done for.

He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.

You'll hate me now, won't you?

Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.

You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.

Mustn't do that, sir.

It's not even noon --

But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!

But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?

More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.

That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.

His rug.

Valcour. His chair.

A man after my own heart...

I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.

This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?

It's a formality; truly.

What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?

Do you favor its publication?

Shut down?

Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?

Of course.

Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.

What could cause a tincture like this?

Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.

Poorly.

Enough!

Quite.

Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!

Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.

Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?

Oh, you. You talk same as you write.

Go on, child.

-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --

I pray you: be succinct.

Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.

It's tainted money, Doctor.

It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...

I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?

Not you too

I wonder sometimes.

Am I?

Mr. Welles certainly is a caution

And he did.

Why is that, Louis?

Nothing for you to worry about, darling

How much?

How much?

There is nothing to discuss-

I don't want you to--

Yes?

"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."

Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--

Can I talk to Hearst?

Telling stories.

You're a laugh-riot, kid.

How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!

I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!

When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--

She was . . . innocent

And when he looks up? What does he dream about?

To my invaluable comrade Drink up!

Uh huh.

Christ.

What does this have to do with--?

What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!

Kinda.

George...

Yeah, ain't it swell?

And they went to the stockholders in New York.

That's for me to decide.

No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.

Get out

Again.

Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--

Please don't ask me to do this.

The ad..

Then find another theater

Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!

That soulless monster gets no tears from me.

No, we're jake. But listen-

The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.

Happy birthday.

Five...? Yes. No. We're done today

We done?

Yes!

I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.

For what?

Tommy, thanks for coming over.

Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.

You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.

Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.

Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.

Here's your glove.

See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.

Whadda you care?

What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...

Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.

No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.

Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.

I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...

What do you mean?

When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.

Yeah, except fall down. That's right.

No, I just told you what happened.

Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.

You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.

Does that mean...

What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?

Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?

Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.

I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.

Can you see it?

If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.

Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.

What do you mean, "good looking?"

Who asked you?

I'm not interested in him.

Positive.

All I did...

Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.

What's that kissing on the mouth shit?

I went to the movies.

"Father of the Bride."

I am answering...

Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.

You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.

Yeah --

What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?

Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.

Are you drunk?

I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.

Don't make no difference no more.

Never felt better.

He should.

He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?

Right, the gym.

Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?

I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.

I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?

You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.

And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.

Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.

Namely?

Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.

Well, officer -- do your duty.

I'll bet it's been done.

You think I made all this up?

I think they missed their chance with her.

Then where is she -- in the ice box?

What time?

Who left -- where?

What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?

Well, in the garage, back home, we --

If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.

For getting rid of that cast.

Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.

You did.

You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.

I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.

It's me.

The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?

Did you get my note?

I only have a hundred dollars or so.

Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!

Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.

Lisa Fremont.

She expects me to marry her.

No.

Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.

I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"

She pay you much?

How did you know!

It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.

Get back there! He'll see you!

Uh-huh.

You called the police?

Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.

And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.

There's something buried there.

Smart girl.

Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.

I'm afraid it is, Tess.

Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.

He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.

Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.

Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.

That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 

Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?

You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --

Three.

You mean "goodnight."

Homework. It's more interesting.

To get on home.

Someone not his wife?

Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?

Inside stuff?

I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.

Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.

I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.

Good luck, Buzz.

What?

Somebody find him a knife.

Hi.

You still want to go home, Moose?

Hold it, Jim.

You make any sandwiches?

I'm not hungry.

Is there some kind of trick answer?

I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.

That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.

Have some cigars.

I think I know my son.

Really, Frank?  When was that?

A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.

Just relax, please relax!

Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?

That's right!

I still think you should go down.

Do you hear from him, son?

Plato.

In my mother's drawer.

Head-shrinker?

What's the charge?

What?

They're still there!

How'd you find me?  What's happening?

Hey!  How 'bout that!

I'm fine.

No.  At dawn.

It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--

You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?

Grandma?

I don't know why--!

She eats him alive and he takes it.

"If he could" what?  You mean your father?

Chicken?

Yes, ma'am.

"Life is crushing in on me."

Who lives?

I'm not so bad.

They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?

Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.

I feel as if I'm walking under water.

Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.

Are you?

You don't need to do that.

What?

Yes.  My best friend.

Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."

Hi.

He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!

Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--

No.  I don't even know why I do it.

What?

We were romantic then too--

I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.

Gabriel, let him go --

YES!!!

I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!

We're talking, aren't we?

...whoever she is.

We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --

One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.

C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.

Thank you.

Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.

Had some bad relationships, didn't you.

Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!

Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?

We could live it up and --

Nick...

Your brother...

Nick --

Nick, I love you --

Nick, it won't work. It won't work!

You're in on this.

But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.

All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...

You saved me.

Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.

I don't know...

I'm almost done.

Is there any way you could get into his truck?

They all are. Football's on.

We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?

We still gonna spend Christmas together?

You shouldn't have.

I'm glad it was me.

The hell I can't.

I shared his cell!

What college.

Hey.

You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.

...ttt..tt... two out of three?

Nothing... I promise-nothing...

I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum

Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.

What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?

How'd you know my name...

How'd you know my name was Rudy.

Leave the tree.

We understand you, Mr. Bangs.

The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.

Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.

My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.

I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --

Fuckin' freezing.

I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.

Fuckin, Zookerman --

Haven't thought about it.

Yeah.

Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.

You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!

Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember

Well...sorry...

They changed the layout.

No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.

Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.

Where was she from, Compton?

Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!

This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.

And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?

So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.

I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.

I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.

It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."

This better not be some Freddy joke.

You ever seen this motherfucker before?

Yeah.

I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.

It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.

Chew? Toby Chew? No.

Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.

Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.

You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.

What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!

Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.

Give me my book.

Sorry, it's my book now.

She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.

How many employees?

No, they're not.

Juicy, junior, real juicy.

That's your proof?

Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!

Mr. Pink.

Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.

That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.

Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.

You're not gonna fucking die, all right?

I can' take you to a hospital.

Lie back down, and try to -

You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.

Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?

Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?

This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.

I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?

Uh-uh, just cops.

How can you be so sure?

Where?

That was the plan, we meet here.

I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.

That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.

Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.

You gotta idea, spit it out.

Well, he knows a little about me.

I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.

Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.

Nobody. The light was bad.

Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.

Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.

I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.

And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.

I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.

Would you, Mr. Phillips?

Like sticking his nose into other people's business.

He's learning his letters.

No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.

I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.

Thanks.

Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.

Maybe it's better that way.

What?

Maybe they will.

Goodbye, Mary.

Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.

To the other side of the street.

Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.

I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.

I don't want to run short.

Yes.

Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.

Good thing you didn't.

You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.

I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.

But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?

Just the grub box and bed rolls.

You better start.

Kind of sore.

Nobody asked you to.

Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!

He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?

Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.

Then why stay in the hills.

Thank you, Mr. Graham.

They shouldn't have done that.

Now where's she goin'? --

That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --

Maybe you are. I'm not.

That's it then.

Everybody knows --

One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.

Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.

Since I can remember, Ma'am.

I sure would.

That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.

Why not? You went farther than that last time.

Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.

It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.

Thanks, Steve.

I think he wants me.

In room "302" at ten o'clock?

Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.

Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.

Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.

Hey, I have an idea...

It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!

Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...

Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.

But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.

Hello Ray.

Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.

Sure, that would be cool. Friends.

It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?

Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?

I know, but I've been thinking --

Look, what I'm trying to say --

Oh.

That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.

Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!

Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.

Yeah, they're so warm and soft.

Yeah, I broke my fall.

Um, I'm not touching anything.

We have to destroy him.

My child, you're alive!

Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?

Gear. You know, clothing.

Now you gotta learn the correct slang.

Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.

Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.

Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.

Theo, did you see the animal?

What are you getting at, Professor?

Let me see the files.

Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.

Are you sure it's not the tape?

And sexy.

Just a little Rogaine.

Oh, I couldn't do that.

Alright. Come on, you guys.

Thanks, handyman.

Second best.

Alright, go to the belt store...

Father, come in, please.

Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.

Then let us prepare.

What?

No, I'm fine.

Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.

Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.

I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.

The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.

What happened?

You don't think...

Jeeezzz!

You said you hated him.

It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!

If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?

Do you have the musical, "Annie"?

Why?

Keep the change, you son of a psycho!

But Mom, the video's not over.

Oh Mom...

I'm so happy I could shit.

You scared me.

But, Chip...

This is so silly. 

Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...

Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?

Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?

Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.

BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!

I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.

We can be real quiet...

You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!

It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.

I certainly did.

Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?

Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.

It's not fair!!

Socially... I'll have a beer.

Let the record show I'm just standing here.

Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.

Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.

Watch the booth! I'll be back! 

NO! I could never hurt anyone!

Yes, but I lent it...

Yes you are.

From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.

I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?

That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.

Sure I do.

Can we go there now?

No.

You could go and open the door.

No.

Thank you.

I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.

What sort of danger?

As a man, you distrust me - perhaps you believe me as a physician.

How much have you got?

Hello, Frances.

"The Dante?"

But I like teaching school.

I did her hair.

I'm not a youngster. I can understand.

He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.

But you have treated me that way.

Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.

Yes.

I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.

And then?

Yes.

But you're always at the library.

I don't think that's so revealing.

But it's a small room, Jason.

Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.

Don't make me tell you, Jason.

It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --

I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.

And Gregory -- he loves her.

What's wrong, Mary?

They may have been friends of hers.

My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.

I don't think that you would understand if I told you.

Uhhuh.

Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.

I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --

It might have.

Cloven hoof?

I don't know.

One believes - it's like any other religion...

A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.

No. She's no longer under my care.

I never thought you did.

No, she's with her sister,

Thank you, my dear.

She's not been here for a long time.

Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?

Please.

Why

What?

What about Judd -- he knows about us.

We haven't even begun tea yet.

Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.

It won't hurt.

Yes?

Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?

Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.

I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?

What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.

Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.

I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.

I feel like they do.

Impotent.

Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.

Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.

Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.

Mostly. Sometimes they do things.

Yes.

Don't you want to make one?

What would you know about a normal frame of mind?

Ann Bishop Millaney.

Sometimes. Afterward.

It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?

Yes.

Why?

Yes.

No.

So you have had sex.

So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?

What was the problem?

I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...

I'm not in love with you.

Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?

Yes.

Not entirely.

I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.

Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.

Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?

Are you having an affair?

My sister, for one. Is that who it is?

But I'm not.

Why don't I believe you?

I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...

Isn't therapy helping at all?

I want out of this marriage.

Yes!

Yes.

Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?

What do you mean?

Radon leakage?

No, I haven't.

Did you confront John about the visitor?

Is he still at your house?

Did you find him attractive?

I guess.

Yes.

Why?

Why?

Well, I wonder why.

I have a pretty good idea.

And... do whatever it is you do.

Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.

What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?

Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?

Well, what? Is he dangerous?

Then why'd you call me?

What kinds of questions?

Did he ask you to take your clothes off?

You don't know that for sure.

You touched him?

What is it?

Did you take your clothes off?

So will you, someday.

She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.

Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.

Nothing.

I just want to ask you questions.

Yes.

That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.

No.

I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.

Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.

It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.

He said that my hand felt good.

Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?

I did.

No, I mean doing it at my house.

Maybe.

You're intrigued?

In here!!

Cynthia. John.

Nothing wrong with trying.

What's so stupid about it?

It hurts that you would say that to me.

By definition you're lying to Ann, too.

God, you... you're mean.

Will you lease month-to-month?

How about for five hundred?

I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.

I'm not going to give you my keys.

Brian Kirkland, please.

Yes?

He'll be really mad.

Sure.

Yes.

Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.

Uh, OK. Sure.

I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.

Nick, you're so strange...

Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.

I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.

Just breathe normally.

Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.

You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.

No? How come?

I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.

OK, Rog. See you at ten.

YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME

BREAKING OUT

Good!  I'm gonna be there.

Of course.

What?

As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.

I got it!  I got it!!!

I've caught it once or twice.

WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS

Dentonvale has been sold.

Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.

I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?

Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...

Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.

I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE

SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY

Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'

He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.

The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.

Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.

Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?

You're practically naked!

OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!

YOUNG BLOOD

Me?

Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.

If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.

Do you really think so?

I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...

Flavors!

We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.

What does he know about it?

I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.

I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.

Good. That's good.

Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.

I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.

I love you.

Yeah, I'm here.

So I guess that's it.

Gary.

Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.

Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.

Bottle.

I'm good.

Sure I know Maya. Real well.

I know. I might need to be spanked.

Good. How're you?

You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!

Maybe. Recognize this?

Yeah, Conundrum.

Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.

Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.

I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.

And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.

It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.

Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.

I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?

I owe her a call anyway.

Yeah, that would be a good move.

Pour us a couple.

You know her?

You know that chick?

This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.

Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.

Shut up.

Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.

About a month ago. Six weeks.

You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?

What?

I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.

Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?

Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.

We were supposed to play golf.

Count me out.

Okay! Jesus!

Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.

Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...

Understanding of what?

Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?

Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.

Put me down, Jack.

Shut up! Shut up, Jack!

I know what you need.

Yeah.

Huh. Let me think.

Looks like you were in a bad car accident.

Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?

What?

Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.

Hold on.

I'll pay for it.

So I'll see you at the rehearsal.

Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?

Oh, no, actually. Busy night.

I finished it.

A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.

Hey.

Yeah. Definitely.

Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.

Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.

A paper?

I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...

What about me?

I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.

Good. So did I.

Well, nice to see you now.

Great. What's the latest we can get there?

What rehearsal dinner?

Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.

Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.

Yeah.

Oh, Miles. You're drunk.

Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.

I guess.

We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.

She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.

He had to make a phone call.

Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.

Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.

You golf?

Where?

And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.

Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.

Does she ever answer back?

She doesn't answer me either.

This one?

Don't touch him.

That's weird.

It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...

Yes it was.

Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?

That wasn't the answer you wanted?

What time is it?

The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.

Ray Reddy's house.

Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?

While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.

We have to go in the basement.

They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.

Graham.

Yes.

I have some upstairs.

It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.

I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.

The footprints.

There are none.

No.

You take care of yourself...  Graham.

He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.

Pinned? What does that mean?

Yeah.

What do you mean, the horses?

That's why they got you in jail?

...And you had to kill him?

What friend is that?

Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.

There's nobody coming?

Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.

Yeah... maybe. So long.

Sure.

I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.

I'm sorry.

Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.

She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.

Right.

I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.

This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.

I haven't done anything.

You got no idea what they were after?

Where's Turley?

Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.

Going to Turley, was it?

It's a town...

Which way do you mean?

Yeah?

I'm going to California with my brother.

Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.

She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.

I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.

What now?

He'll be here.

All I did was kiss the girl.

What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.

Who did it?

Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.

Rae, I need help.

They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.

I heard that too.

It's been a while.

This is a lot of money.

It is that.

We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.

Thanks. That's what I call it too.

So-called?

Who's the owner?

If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.

I like your attitude. But it can be risky.

He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.

It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.

I am telling the truth.

No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.

You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.

It sounds like you still have feelings for him.

Okay -- for you.

Difficult.  I'm difficult.

Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.

We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!

How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.

You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.

Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.

Almost right.

As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.

No problem.  Do you want to come in?

There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".

She'll drive herself.

No need.  She does all her own stunts.

Even the fall from the plane.

Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?

Soon.  Soon.

Everyone you know is lying.

Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.

No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?

Impossible.

No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.

No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.

Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.

It was a great show, Dad...

Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.

Of course.

Yes, call me Simone.

And what may I ask brought this on?

But she's right there!  I must feel her!

Why not?

I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?

You want me to call Security?

That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?

I've seen them all before.

I need flesh and --

You do?

You saw that?

We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.

It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --

Is she here tonight?

Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.

You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.

Night, Lainey.

Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?

No, that was me.

I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!

I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.

Abduction?

I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.

That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.

Long live the First Amendment.

You're in breach.

Taller, Viktor.

After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.

Yes, I'd like that.

Thank you.

But that's Simone's part.

... digitized.

No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.

Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?

You know what I'm talking about.

Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.

What? You don't see enough of me at the store?

Tell me.

...De profundis clamo ad te domine.

That's good.

How do you draw now?

I guess they don't.

That I'm a freak.

I forgot myself.

You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.

I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.

Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.

Yes, I am.

Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?

I guess she did.

Where will you go, where no one has died?

Maybe.

Really?

I'm ready to communicate with you now.

Tell you my secrets.

Oh my God.

They scare me too sometimes.

Ghosts.

They want me to do things for them.

You're a stuttering Stanley!

Stop looking at me.

--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!

J. C. Penny's?

Chicken blood on the crops.

I ain't never played a banjo in my life.

Tramp.

Bitch.

Someone actually... employs you?

Which street corner?

No shit.

Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.

Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."

Book of Jeremiah.

I could. You sucked.

Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.

-- "Billy-Jean" --

Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.

He's right. Nice guitar break.

Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?

Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.

Pardon?

"Blood?"

That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.

I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?

Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.

Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.

What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!

Amen.

Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.

Nothing to tell.

When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...

You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --

Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...

Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.

Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.

Bill, we need to talk!

Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.

Whatcha' doin'?

I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.

No. What?

Starla, it ain't --

I'm sorry.

Okay.

A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.

The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.

Shut up.

What can I do you for?

Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.

What other stuff?

We ain't never gonna find that girl now.

If...?

What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.

Last year, this was a new rig.

Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.

Would I lie to you?

We lost him.

I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.

Eleven.

Enjoy your Kenworth.

Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.

He's after us again!

Do I know? I'm an authority on it.

Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?

And?

Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?

Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?

Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?

Six. Got it.

Yeah?

Redneck heaven.

Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?

Yeah, guy?

Then don't.

Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?

Now what?

I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.

I'll believe it when I see it.

I'm here.

I'm cucumber cool.

Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.

Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.

You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.

That's the point, Dickey.

Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.

-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.

Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.

Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.

Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?

Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.

You woulda?

Yeah, why.

...About what?

Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.

-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.

I sent Hugo, he should be there!

That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.

I got his machine.

Okay.

Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?

...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?

Only if you really, truly mean it.

Without peer?

That's right! RIGHT NOW!

GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!

-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --

I thought Heller was a double op?

Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.

Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.

We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.

-- You can and you will.

The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...

Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.

Nah, nuthin' on my end --

Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.

-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.

Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.

Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.

Nah, nuthin' on my end --

Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?

Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.

What!?

No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --

C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?

You're not Gibarian...

A puppet.

In the lab.  With her, probably.

We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.

Not her.  It.

He'll let me in.

Who was it?

That depends.

Shut up.

To who?

I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.

-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.

I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?

Human beings can die.

Just get him to stop.

Her oxygen would have run out.

I love her.

I won't be making the trip.

I'll go with you.

It's something.

The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!

It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.

Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.

He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.

I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.

I can't stay here.

Then you won't make it.

Yes, you are --

I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?

It's an experiment.

Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?

They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.

You still writing the occasional magazine article?

No, Ma'am.

Beg pardon?

Not too sure about that.

Sooner, the better.

Hmm...

Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.

And "is"...?

You don't like him, do you?

Do you dance?

Long enough.

So.

It was something my father always liked me to do.

... I don't want to talk about it...

Nothing.

Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.

I think television's a dangerous thing.

You don't want to hear about it.

I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.

I might stop you.

It's not your taste.

I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...

Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.

What about Tommy?

I just sat and listened.

You apprehended him after he gave himself up --

Koontz!  I need you guys!

It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!

I just gotta talk to her, T.J.

She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.

I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.

I know where everything is.

Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...

She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.

You stop him?

A little bunny I saved from dissection.

Harry

Just call me Spidey.

I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--

I hate people with alliterative names.

Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?

You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.

Does it have a human name?

So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...

I know him.

Any sign of our friend?

--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.

Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--

You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.

See?  You big dullard.

Aunt May, what happened?

Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?

I'll try. Thanks.

Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--

I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?

Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.

Like it?

Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.

Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?

The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?

Bonkers.

I wouldn't talk about things like that.

There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?

Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?

Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.

Looks good outside.

We'll get some more.

In this barracks?

Who is it?

Take it.

Forget it.

Okay, Security -- what happened?

Everybody but Joey, and you know who.

Twenty-five.

Sefton!

What are the chances busting out of here?

What is your number?

Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.

Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.

It's a mouse trap.

I don't care if they wear galoshes!

Where'd that come from?

Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.

You hold him. I'll slug him.

Do Jimmy Durante!

Hey, Animal! Animal!

Animal! Animal! Wake up!

Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?

Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.

Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.

Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?

Because that's where he is. In the water tank.

Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.

Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?

Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?

Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.

You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.

You can tell Father Murray to --

Nothing for Kuzawa?

Just what makes you so popular?

Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.

Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?

Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?

The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.

Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?

All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.

Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...

Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?

How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?

Yes, you do!

Not particularly.

Where is he?

I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!

Thanks for pointing that out.

The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.

Can you project its course?

Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.

Approximately two hundred thirty million.

No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.

You get what?

The station complement was nineteen.

I'll go. You have the Bridge.

Wherever he wanted to be.

Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.

No, no. Thank you.

Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-

That's right.

You could say that.

Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.

I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.

Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!

I was ordered to by the Captain.

No.

Yeah, they're full of great ideas.

Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.

You want me to contact Starfleet?

Understood. That will be all.

In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.

Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.

Lock phasers and return fire!

Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?

And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!

He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.

Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  

An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...

I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.

Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.

Nothing. As before.

Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.

Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?

Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...

Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!

A photon tube...!

We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!

Spock's burial robe.

Logic indicates that is the case.

That may be difficult...

... How long?

Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.

Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.

I'll try to remember that, Captain.

We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...

We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --

Sir...?

Aye, sir!

Aye, sir!

They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!

Just him, sir!

Saavik... Is... David with you?

She's to be decommissioned.

Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?

Fire, Mr. Scott!

No, sir, no response.

My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...

Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.

Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.

No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.

Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.

Yes...

Put him on screen!  Study him well.

Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.

How is that...?

I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --

That's all you have to say?

They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.

'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...

Thank you.

Bones, I don't want to be lectured.

Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.

Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.

Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --

What do you want with us? I demand --

Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...

I'm Doctor Marcus!

What?

Only half of you would get there.

I don't know.

We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!

Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.

Visual --

... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...

Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.

Aye, sir.

A few shots, sir.

I'm trying, sir. Stand by...

Picture, Mr. Saavik.

Sensors, Captain?

My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.

No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.

Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.

Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.

Yes, SIR.

Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?

The word is given: warp speed.

To be sure, Captain.

Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.

You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.

I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.

Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?

The power of creation --

Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --

And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...

... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?

Aye sir --

Best we could do in two hours.

Spock...!

Transmission jammed at the source, sir.

Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!

It is still regulation, Admiral.

There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.

HURRY.

Erased...

If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.

The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.

On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.

At what.

Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.

Try again.

Battle stations.

Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.

Ready, sir.

Honors -- hup!

What did you expect, Lieutenant?

Never, sir.

You are half human. The Computer knows that.

It'll come back to him.

-- That's the general idea.

Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.

Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...

Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.

I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.

Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?

That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?

Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.

It is.

Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!

Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!

Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!

It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.

Shields, aye.

Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.

Is there something wrong with the one I have?

To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.

LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.

You've already been that. C'mon.

In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.

It's his way.

... You're very perceptive.

You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.

If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?

It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.

Tell me when the whales are going to be released?

You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?

Right.

But Kirk...

Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...

To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.

The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.

In progress, Admiral.

What is our target in time?

Explain.

But you said toxic.

Yes.

You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.

I see.

Exaggerate.

The hell I can't

How will playing cards help?

The tank will be finished by morning...

No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.

Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?

Right.  Will you help us?

Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.

Weapons systems?

Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.

Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!

Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...

Yes, sir.

Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.

283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...

Nothing... I should never have left him...

Uhura!... Where!

Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.

How long, Scotty?

On my way...!

Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.

That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.

Just use the keyboard...

I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.

But not you.

You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?

It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.

I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.

There are caves in those mountains.

What's the rush?

You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.

You're what?

My power cells continually re- charge themselves.

I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...

Androids... don't have...fun.

Tournel will take you the rest of the way...

Bye.

Data doesn't breathe.

Captain, Geordi...?

It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...

Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...

Good. Let's begin to move these people out...

Will the structure hold if we blast through?

I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...

In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.

That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...

Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...

I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.

The Ba'ku.

Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?

Do you know how to disable the injector?

Why would they fire at him without provocation?

So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.

It's nothing. I'm just tired.

You got me, Commander.

Eject the core.

Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...

Remind me to lodge a protest...

Commander Riker...

No, we're here to... rescue them.

Yes... yes, I... can hear you...

It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.

The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...

Sir?

Beam him out!

Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...

Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...

Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...

Good question.

Was I doing something to your neck?

No children?

But it's comfortable.

... I believe you...

Augh?

They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.

Absolutely.

Yes...

It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.

I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.

It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.

A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?

And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.

Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.

According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.

I am the Borg.

But how?

I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...

Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.

Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.

Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.

There should be some kind of manual release...

Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?

We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...

It'll have to wait. Come on.

Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...

Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...

There's a red light on the second intake valve.

I'm on it...

It'll be tight, but we should make it.

You don't sound French.

It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.

And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...

Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.

Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?

We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.

This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.

Fire.

Aye, sir.

Data, set a course for that vortex.

Steady as she goes.

Worf... torpedo... now!

In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.

It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.

We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.

We've lost Bridge control!

Nothing.

We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --

Where the hell are they going?

Hold that thought.

Riker here.

What kind of message?

At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.

I'm going too. They may need a doctor.

We DO sleep lying down.

We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...

We're not finished.

If they're even looking for us...

Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...

Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?

You feign ignorance?

Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?

Well, I -

Aye, sir; thrusters...

Onscreen.

Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..

Give a girl a chance, Captain.

I like it here...

Kill him! He's the one!!

Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.

There's a reward for your death.

We didn't kill Gorkon.

Except us.

Where do we come in?

Energize...

Aye, sir.

Captain.

You hear that?

You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.

I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...

Thank you, Captain Sulu.

There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.

According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...

So, that's it..

Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -

Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?

In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.

A lie?

I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.

Confirmed, Captain!

Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.

Visual!

What's left of it.

I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.

I think  not.

Nevertheless.

That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.

How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?

Yes, sir.

At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.

No. Can I move now?

He turned out all right.

Is he very much like you were?

I wish I could believe that, Doctor.

Can you describe it, Deanna?

Dying?

I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.

That was another time.

Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...

To happy endings.

New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...

I can see that.

Sorry, sir.

Good work. The download?

Aye, sir... This way.

It would appear so.

We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?

Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?

At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.

Of you?

I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.

It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?

He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?

An individual more like you, you mean.

Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.

The resemblance is... striking.

The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.

What do we know about the planet?

Theories?

Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.

And that's exactly what he's going to do.

The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.

Aye, sir.

I'll take care of it, sir.



Just lucky, Admiral.

Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...

On screen.

I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.

A coup d'etat?

It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.

Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.

We can only hope so.

I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?

The honor was mine. Captain Riker.

You're not Reman.

I won't defend my life to you.

Why are you here?

He is what his life has made him!

So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?

But you want to.

You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!

Disruptors are off-line, sir.

It is... invigorating.

We're being hailed.

He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.

Find her again.

A matter of hours now.

Seven minutes.

I came this far alone ...

I have a purpose.



There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.

No, we can handle this.

I understand.

I make maps.

Eh... yes.

Thank you.

What the hell do you think you're doing?

We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.

You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.

It's in a green Mustang?

It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.

I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.

I'm gonna be here if you need anything.

I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.

Shermin...

I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.

Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...

What.

Steering wheel.

Good.

That way.

Flashlight.

I am Jenny Haydn.

Shit?

Shit... shit... what shit?

No.

Yes.

Yes. Day... night.

When we get here.

I know that. But the buses don't go there.

I do not speak English.

The car will stop?

Go?

What?

No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...

We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.

I don't understand 'friend.'

He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.

I understand.

What is hell?

He will.

Are you my friend?

I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?

On the radio they say it's good.

You don't make money gambling. You lose it.

Many, many days and nights...

Where?

Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.

Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.

My grandmother's rich.

I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.

We're ready.

Save us all a lot of trouble.

Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.

It was only an accident that we discovered them.

Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.

I wouldn't think so.

I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.

Yeah, right.

Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.

Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.

Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.

Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.

My God.

I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.

I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.

Tonight.

Damn right.

Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?

We should talk alone.

Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.

Thanks, Max.

Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.

I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?

So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.

Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.

Where's Faith?

Naawww.

Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.

Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?

Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.

Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.

Coming with you.

I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.

I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.

No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.

You'll see.

It is my sword and my shield, Macey.

Black.  Jack.

I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.

Because Iris knew somebody was after her.

So the guy's not a sicko.

Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?

That's where it gets a little strange.

OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.

S'okay.  I know you still love me.

Jesus, Mace!

This tie doesn't go with blue!

Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.

You sure?

People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.

Why?

Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.

Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.

You never told me.

Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.

Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.

Yeah.  We did.

Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.

Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?

Take the tape to the cops.

You really want that on your head?

Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?

Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?

Ten miles back on the Texas side.

That's right, Jan.

This isn't in our database?

Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.

And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?

She's buried.

Not as much as you'd think.

Why me? What do you want from me!?

Yes.

Just an observer.

Another what?

From the grave?

They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.

Huh?, sir.

An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.

I was looking for a pattern.

I need to get to Amarillo immediately.

There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.

How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.

Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --

Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.

How long have you been downtown?

It explains a lot.

And one other thing.

Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?

I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.

Huh?

Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?

"Intra-Agency fraternizing."

Does Koessler ask about me?

What did you tell him?

No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.

You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.

Not the way I can.

Jaime? Where are you?

What's up?

Slow down a second, you met with Low --

Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.

No weapon.

I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.

I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.

Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.

You knew it was me all along?

I already have an employer.

Maybe you should back off.

[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]

[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]

[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]

[You tell me.]

I screwed up twice, sir.

I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.

This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.

No. Stop, come on.

Shuddup.

...maybe...

Just like that?

Anything.

Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...

...and even then...

What else is going on?

Hey, man. At least it's Disney.

Don't worry. He's in good hands.

...And she's with someone else.

No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.

Sorry?

Oh... right.

Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.

Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.

Listen. I had a great time.

If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.

Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 

Fine... I guess. You?

What kind of things?

Really?

It sucks.

I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.

Well, until now. Tend the pin.

I don't know. Eight or Nine.

It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.

Bud.

Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.

No. Just O.J.

Well, you're doing so well...

...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.

Sure.

Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.

Damned if I know...

I can't believe you.

Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 

Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?

What are you talking about? Vegas?

What Vegas?

Whu?

This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.

Baby, there are beautiful babies here.

We're gonna get laid, baby.

What?!?

Yeah? Well obviously not always!

That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.

Did she, or did she not smile.

You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.

It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.

Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...

I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.

"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...

I hope so.  We gotta go soon.

Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.

Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...

Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."

What?

She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?

Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.

Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?

Yeah. You met him once.

What a surprise.

Chelios to Roenick...!

Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!

You are so money, and you don't even know it...

Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.

Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...

...it is so on.

Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.

Be smart about it.

You don't have to wait three days...

...just be smart about it.

Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.

You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.

An eye for an eye!

Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.

I'll come to you when I need you.

I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!

Barzini.

Shut up.

Like hell I will.

Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?

Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!

And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?

Sure.

Barzini.

No.

I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.

I'll need him.

And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.

You look good, too.

No.

Mike!

No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.

Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.

Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.

Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.

Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.

Not so perfectly if you noticed.

You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.

They're waiting to see my father.

Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...

Sure.

No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.

Yeah Kay, I'm here.

My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.

All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.

How's Mom?

Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.

Until the old man tells me different.

All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.

Cut it out.

Probably a year...

I do renounce him.

I do renounce them.

I do wish to be baptized.

Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?

I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.

You just woke up!

Is that good?

I don't get it.

It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.

Oh, it was.

It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.

Say again?

That's funny.

No, I think your mother, her illness --

A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.

Copy out from here...

Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.

Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.

I thought you'd missed the train.

Is Freddie here?

You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.

I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?

Ripley's plans.

I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!

Really? To Italy?

I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.

Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!

Aye, aye.

It's Freddie. Let me in.

Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?

He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.

Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.

Tom. How are you? You look well.

Far cry from New York.

We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --

Such as?

Thanks, yes, I think we did.

I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.

Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?

Frances?

I'm fine.

Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.

I think you're right.

I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --

Dickie did it.

Get on. I'll take you to him.

I can explain.

Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.

Why? When?

I don't believe a single word you've said.

He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?

Do you know Tom?

As in the...?

I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.

Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.

I know.

Just kidding. Are you alone?

Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?

Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?

That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.

What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?

Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.

Just because he doesn't like Americans!

Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...

It's okay.

I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.

Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?

I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.

I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.

Even your fiancée...?

November 7th is my information.

May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?

It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 

Who mam?

Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 

I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"

I know. I could have picked you up.

You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.

I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.

Oh. Who was that again?

Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.

Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.

I bought a couple of tickets.

The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?

I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.

I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --

We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.

Could you see anything?

And what happened?

And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"

I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?

It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.

Easy.

I don't like my real name.

You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.

It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 

Pittsburgh.

At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.

He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.

Me? I could never go to a place like that.

I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.

I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.

I can't. Otherwise, I would.

Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!

Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!

Yes.

Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.

Military record?

I'm no cop.  I want some action.

Things got ya down?

I know.

Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.

Neither do I, I guess.

Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.

Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.

What is happening?  Where's Mason?

Don't let him do that.

Wrong.

Now they only have three rockets left.

The cell, Mason.

Womack ripped it up, right?

Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.

Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...

Delly?  In here.

Well...

Honey, I... I can't... it's the...

You look... different.

And why not?

You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.

Yeah...

I'm  fine.  Really.  

Exactly.  And he got good.

Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"

Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"

Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?

Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.

I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.

Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.

Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?

Well, son, you're home!

You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?

The Bijou?

Good to meet you.  Again.

Thanks.

Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.

Who... are they?

Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.

Yeah, I know, but poultry...?

Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.

Yes?

Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.

Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.

Then I'll call you a cab.

Pete...

Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...

Aren't you coming?

Can we get him to the hospital?

I... I don't believe this.

I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!

Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!

I was decorated.

Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.

That's not the country Luke fought for.

Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?

No, I...

Yeah... me too.

Oh...

I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?

'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?

They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.

It's a lovely garden.

No. Just a few hours.

Yes?

Yes.

It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.

I think so.

I despise it.

Where are you from originally, Annie?

Because she was afraid.

No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.

Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.

That's up to you.

Then go.

Well, I suppose...

Darling, of course I do!

Is she all right?

The little Brenner girl.

Morning.

Yep.

That's where the Brenners live.

Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.

Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?

Okay.

Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.

They're back!

Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...

No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.

I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...

Yes, Mother.

Mother?

I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.

I don't know when.  We'll see what...

I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.

But they'll be back.

Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.

Annie's there. She'll be all right.

Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.

Yes, but the curtains were drawn.

Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...

No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?

That's all right.

These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.

Aren't these lovebirds?

I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.

Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.

What made it...

Criminal.

I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?

What for?

Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.

Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?

None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?

You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?

I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...

Yes, but...

I wrote the letter.

Yes.

I told you what happened in Rome!

Why?

You have a job?

At Annie's house. She's all right.

The bay doesn't.

You said three o'clock.

I have no idea.

How soon?

Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?

Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...

...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...

What were the crows after at the school?

I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!

No one called it a war!

Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.

Can we go on living here otherwise?

Then let's go. Now!

Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.

All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.

Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.

Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.

Good morning, Mr. Fettes.

It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.

I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.

You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.

But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.

Come in, boy -- come in.

Excuse me.

You're made for a doctor, young man!

You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --

Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.

Gray killed her.

Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.

When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.

No.

No.

Don't call me that confounded name.

What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.

I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.

There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.

I have other means of sustenance.

But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.

I know --

Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."

No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.

I never heard that song. But what did they do?

That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!

No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --

Yes, Doctor.

A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.

But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.

Where are they? Last chance.

Dream on.

"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.

I'm thinking... that explains a lot.

Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?

A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.

Nobody.

I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.

I'm not hiding. I'm right here.

My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.

No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...

Erin. I'll always be with you.

I know.

Sign of the dead come back to life.

He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.

Doubt is a motherfucker.

Let's hope not. License and registration please.

Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.

This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.

Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.

Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!

Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.

Yes, sir -- it certainly does!

That was my first question.

Would you care to be more specific?

My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.

I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.

Of course, dear.

No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.

I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!

Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.

Velocity is the time rate of change of position.

Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?

Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?

Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.

Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.

He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.

Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.

From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.

I mean the reasons for my coming here.

I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?

Is it real?

Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.

What about him?

All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.

Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.

Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.

May I see you for a minute?

Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--

I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.

Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--

Who?

You mean he has the power of life and death?

They would have killed this man?

No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?

This one could save your life.

Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?

Zero.

We unraveled in the face of the enemy!

Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.

What?...

Get your bike.  We're going someplace.

Hey, take it easy.

You're one of us, now -- aren't you?

Yeah.

No.  Stick around.

Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?

That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.

What happens in tow and a half hours?

Okay, okay.

Sam, don't --

When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.

'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.

Did we have a date tonight?

Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.

Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.

Oh, no, you won't.

Can't.  Got plans of my own.

Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?

He's already gone to bed.

No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...

C'mere, Nanook.

This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!

I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.

It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...

Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.

No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.

Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.

Well, I...

Tonight.  At the boardwalk...

Okay.

Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.

Save Laddie first.

So do I!

I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.

Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?

Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?

Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'

You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.

I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.

No.  On the phone.

Piss off.

Look at your reflection in the mirror!!

I don't know.

Huh?...

No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...

Yeah.

I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?

Maybe.

I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!

Hell no.

Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...

No.  Just let him freeze out there.

That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?

Was dark... find a light...

No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?

I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?

What?

You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!

We'll see.  Let's try Clark.

The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.

Then we'll never make it.

So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.

Nothing we can do about that.

When was the last time you used it?

After all this mess.

That far?

Don't let up, Childs!

What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?

I ain't going with Sanchez.

Then we go after him.

On the towers?

What else can they do?

What happened?

How did you know?!

It frightens you.

Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.

The air... the power.

Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...

Alexander.

Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.

I'm a foolish man.

You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.

I -- what are you?!

What's happening to the moon?!

You know I can't.

I need to... um... talk to you.

I mean... well... affection.

Hold on... I know I have it...

Not here... alone.  Please.

No... let's walk through the city.

Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?

Alex, it's just the zoo.

The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.

Do you know you were humming?

Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.

I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.

How romantic...

It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.

Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...

When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?

You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!

I pray to God that in a week you're not here.

In a week... we will never have had this conversation.

I'm glad.

Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.

You might find the truth rather hard to understand.

Thank you...

I can see Kalen's point.

What's it all for?

I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?

You liked it there.

I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.

So you can use it now?

Do you have it?!

May I get you some --

Imagine that.

I did...

I took a different route.

We don't know.

Dean Fulton...

What's it like where you come from?

They're here!  They're inside the house -- !

They're inside --

And you've no idea where he went?

I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.

I'm fine.

Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!

My business?

Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.

You sure you know where to find one?

How?

No, we were patients.

I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?

He didn't either.

Oh yeah, what'd he say?

I never touched your father! I swear!

They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.

I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.

[Beat] What do you need me to do?

His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?

Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...

Why?

You two ok?

[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.

[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.

Well, you belong in one.

I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.

[Beat] What?

After I...

What?

You think Lorenson kills you?

Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.

It's Sunday.

Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.

When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?

It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.

That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.

I could try to...make it stop.

So it's helping?

Why would we do that?

Because I don't have time.

How...how do you know?

Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?

You still don't believe me, do you?

Listen to me. That's all I ask.

Who told you this?

Don't you go to jail for that?

[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.

I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.

I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...

Where are you going?

Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.

[Beat] I was dropped off.

Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?

I'll manage.

You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.

No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.

[Beat] I do it.

May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.

Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.

Uh-huh.

See ya.

Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.

You girls are in some hot water.

Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?

My Lord.

It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.

You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.

Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.

Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.

J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.

I'm a robber.

Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.

Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.

Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.

Can't it go to any office?

Maybe.

Why now, Jimmy?

You wanna let me see your license, please?

Okay.  I will, too.

I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.

Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.

I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.

Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?

Yes.

It's probably not a good idea.

Thelma kinda took to him.

He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.

I won't wait up.

You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.

I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!

Taking a shower.

Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!

Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?

They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!

Let's get it over with.

Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!

Just past Boise City.

Yeah.

Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?

About how fast was I going?

Just asking.

Yeah, you want it?

No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.

But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...

It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.

And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...

Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.

About two hundred and fifty miles.

Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!

Oh.

Why?

I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.

Unbearable, I'd imagine.

Where?!

You, too, sweetie, the best.

You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.

Fresno.

Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?

I'll try to be more careful.

The thing's kind of heavy.

No, I just meant...

Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?

Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.

I also called Unsolved Mysteries.

I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!

Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.

Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.

Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.

Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.

No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.

Car clean? Plenty of gas?

Hm?

Pipes? What are you talking about?

No.

But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.

Who?

Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.

Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.

Oh come on, why would I lie?

You got a brew?

No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!

Thanks.

Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.

I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.

Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.

Who the fuck is it to you?

You found my car?!

Yep.

I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.

Thanks.

Same here again.

I beg your pardon?

Isn't that a little politically incorrect?

Great.

The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.

When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.

You're a movie buff?

A fucking moron.

What?

Huh... that's strange.

Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?

Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.

You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.

So she's married?

Huh?

Oh my.

She's in a wheelchair?!

Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.

Do what?

You're a sick man, you know that?

Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.

Same here.

Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?

Kim and I are close friends!

Nice smokescreen, isn't it?

Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?

I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?

Maybe this'll jog your memory.

You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.

Hey, this is a pretty nice place.

What?

'That right? Good for you.

Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.

I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.

That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?

Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.

Why?

No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.

Thanks a lot, Ted.

Huh?

Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.

No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.

Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.

What are you?

Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.

I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.

What?! No please, sir --

I think a little of both.

No, that's really unneces --

Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.

Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.

Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.

I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.

Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.

Admiral, I asked you a question.

What --

Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?

We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.

That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?

Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.

Smoke.

-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.

Time is of the essence.

McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.

We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.

Still heading for Cuba.

Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.

The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.

Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.

He was.

No you weren't.

Not as far as the election goes.

Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.

You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.

They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.

And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.

Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --

That may be what they want us to think.

Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!

Just a second, Mr. President.

Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.

FBI? What you investigatin'?

Again. Figures, man.

The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?

Oh, yeah -- right.

It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.

You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.

No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.

That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.

Beats the hell outta me.

Go ahead.

A long way from home. You be careful out there.

I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.

Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --

Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --

You're steppin' on sign.

He knows me?

-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.

What'd you expect to hear?

What you call myths, we call our history.

Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?

Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.

And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.

They found prints at Blue Legs' place.

Crow Horse, listen --

We've driven a long way. Where is this place?

Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.

Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.

You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.

When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?

NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.

I read, Cooch.

Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.

-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.

What the fuck you talkin' about?

Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.

Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?

I was inverted.

You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.

And far too aggressive.

Evan... or Maverick.

I don't enjoy watching things suffer.

It's just as I thought.

Anything.

I'm still second best.

I'm fine.

I was flying...my responsibility.

I don't think so, but if that's what you want...

Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...

That's up to you.

Who's gonna win?

I was, later.

I hope you find him.

Yes sir!

I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.

It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!

What?  What is it?

You're crazy. We're level.

You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!

NO. NO GOOD.

Not anymore.

Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.

Roger, I've got it.

Yawing right.

Rudder's left, stick's forward.

Okay.

On what?

So's my Johnson.

I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.

Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!

Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?

Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.

I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.

Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.

Time to go.

They should have warned you about that one.

It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.

Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.

I didn't ruin her.

GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.

Figured out what?

I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.

Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"

What the hell you doing?

Sir?

Yes sir!

The wings..

Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.

ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

I lost.

Or....

I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.

What was that?  An accident?

But maybe you can change all that.

They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.

Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.

My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.

Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.

Yes, sir.

What is it?

Looks like another schizoid embolism.

Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!

Eight years.

Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.

I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.

Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.

No need to be rude.  I'll do it.

It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.

This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.

Relax, you'll live longer.

You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?

You tell me.

Rekall?

Let me buy you a drink.

Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!

I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.

How did I get in this taxi?!

But I'm always home by morning.

Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.

I'm late.

Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.

No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!

What did they do to you?  Tell me!

Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.

Mars.

Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.

Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?

Blondes.

I guess he didn't.

There's something I have to tell you...

Because you're still working for Cohaagen.

He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.

Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.

If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.

I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?

Enough for everybody to breathe?

I gave you?

That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.

I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?

Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.

We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!

Well, who put you two in charge?

The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.

No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.

VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!

Could we make it to the mountains?

You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?

Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.

Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.

What the hell do we know about seismographs?

Why?

One job I'd never take is working around electricity.

What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!

Val!  Val!

You're hung up again.

Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!

Great.  Thank you.

That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?

Sons of bitches!

Okay, now, how far's your truck?

Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?

Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...

Right.

Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.

A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!

We got a plan!

Not yet, not yet...

Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...

You bet.

They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!

Yeah, Heather, we got you.

Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.

Yeah, geography.

Around here?  Why would they?

Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?

That-a-boy. Hospital.

True.

Correct.

No it is not, Mr. Dowd.

The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?

Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.

Let's snuff this lowlife!

Can't I take a simple piss without --

I can describe it.

Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?

Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.

Right. You're right.

Chinatown street gang.

"Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name?

1530 Rivington Street.

...What do you mean?

Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.

That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.

What's Art Esparza?

You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?

...For ten years, now.

Neither.

"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?

I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.

Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.

I don't need sleep!

...Okay...

I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.

I don't know. The truth, maybe.

"No," what?

It was self-defense.

I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.

No, s-sir.

Mr. Rabin has no right to --

Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.

Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?

What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.

Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...

Objection.

Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.

I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.

I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.

Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...

Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?

And you b-believe that.

She is preparing a great abundance of food.

You killed Mike.

Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.

You're lucky I am not wasting you.

Was there an argument?

That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.

Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.

Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.

CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.

Smell something fishy, huh?

Teresa Banks.

Someone else has it now.

Where's Hap?

I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks

Say no more.

What do you mean?

Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.

Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?

Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?

Very good, but I can't tell you about that.

Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.

That's good.

I don't know, Sam.

Sure, but let's finish up with this first.

It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.

We're not. You and I are going to get some food.

Are you speaking to me in a code?

He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.

You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.

He probably wanted to drive over.

You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.

I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.

Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.

Okay, I suppose I should go home.

Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.

You mean Fred and Ginger?

Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?

What can I tell you?

No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.

I did? I didn't see anything.

Brother, I hear you talkin'.

But Bob isn't real.

Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.

I already made you two tapes.

Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.

Not now.

"Oh, Laura..."

Fish eyes?

What?

Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.

Fine.

Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?

Yes.

This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.

Look at this finger here.

Who am I?

That's right.

Lay off the bennies, Leo.

Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...

I'm kind of busy, Norma.

If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".

Very good.

Well, of course, it's always dangerous...

You thought it was just.

It looks that way.

Does that mean I'm back for awhile?

It's a crime.

Yes.

I...

I... yes.

You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?

That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.

Meth... Methodology and Technique...

...to get her heartbeat back...?

I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.

You may step down.

Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.

Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?

Yes.

My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...

...that's all right.

I completely understand...

Hold on a second.

What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...

No, you did fine.

Yes? Galvin, right?

...and you're going to do that?

Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?

I understand.

Yes...

Yes.

These are your initials, 'K.C.'?

She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.

I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.

What?

Mr. Concannon...?

Overruled...

Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...

I've got to work.

You're going to stay here...?

I have to talk to you.

If you're selling something, I'm late for work...

From the magazine?

How come you're calling me from...?

Kathy Price.

Missus...

Nothing happened.

It's locked.

...I'm sure you do...

...I know. I went...

...fifty thousand dollars?

...I understand...

I'm going to see you get that chance.

Dr. Gruber's not in.

Thanks, Franky.

...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...

...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.

...I'm going to need your help...

They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...

What?

Brindisi versus Electric Boat.

Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?

So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.

Oh shit, what's today?

I can't talk now.

Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.

You use their witness.

...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying...

We got to talk.

Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...

I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...

We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...

Me, too.

That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.

Let's go.

We'd be in all the papers!

All right - I've seen enough!

Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.

I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...

Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!

There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?

Can you handle one of these?

No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!

I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.

Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!

I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.

I liked him.

It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!

It might give us something.

No.  I thought you had them.

I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.

So is the town, I notice!

I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.

It's always been a good persuader.

I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.

There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.

But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --

I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.

Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.

Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?

We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?

He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.

He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.

Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.

Maybe you should tell me your dream.

You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?

Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!

He was just here!

Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...

I like this story.

He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?

Rex woke me up. He was fighting.

Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.

A story?

Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.

Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 

John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!

Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.

Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.

It can be captured, sometimes.

Do you let your child watch your movies?

Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.

Your father?

You miss him.

He knows.

We were idealists.

I haven't forgotten.

Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.

I didn't know sir.

It was an act of God for Christ's sake.

Yes sir.

Yeah.

If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.

Congratulations.

Figured what out?

Me either.

I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.

Nobody says you have to be like me.

Well that's just typical isn't it?

We all have problems.

Maybe it's an air raid.

I can't watch this.

That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?

Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.

Face what?

You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.

Sir...?

He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.

No.

I know.

As you can see, there's a lot to do.

And, of course, we are.

It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?

Yes sir.

On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.

I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.

What is it... the secret?

He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.

No.  Bring him on deck with the others.

It hurts too much to care.

Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.

You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.

What?

He climbed when he was ready.

What makes you so sure it was one?

Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...

Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.

Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.

Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.

How old are you?

No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.

You was in the Marines, huh?

Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?

Sorry to hear it.

Ready for another?

Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.

She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?

Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.

Juana called. They're stayin' another week.

What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?

Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?

Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.

Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.

Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.

Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.

I'm sorry.

Why not? How was the fishin'?

I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?

That bastard Pucinski...

And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...

You ain't actin', mama.

And?

Thinkin' a second, baby.

Why, honey?

That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?

She got me an abortion...

So?

We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.

Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...

Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!

It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?

Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?

That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?

Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.

Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?

You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.

We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.

You do.

He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.

Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.

Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.

Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.

It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.

Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...

Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...

I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.

Yeah, I'm here.

My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.

If you say so.

You think she's gonna make it?

Yeah?

And Bobby too, I hear...

Went with Bobby.

What could I be up to, Lula?

Lula, I got to get some sleep.

Damn!

Really, Lula, this ain't right!

Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.

I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.

That's not why I called.

I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.

Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?

All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.

Shoot him.

No.

Yes.

Yes.

Santos... I can't...

There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...

You heard right.

Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.

Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.

Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.

He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.

Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.

Your wife.

Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.

Back up. Go out the other way.

Where would we go?

First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.

He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.

...we find the jacket.

In a sense.

That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.

And your wife left you.

I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.

Her dog, yes.

No sweat. Only do me a favor?

Where are you, Grady? An elevator?

You're in Kinship?

Are you there to not reconcile with her?

It's very convincing.

It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.

Like the lady herself.

I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.

Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.

No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --

Miss Sloviak's.

I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?

What'd you tell him?

Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.

Well done, James.

No.

Your aunt?

Maybe...

Where's that?

Carvel? Where's Carvel?

Kinship.

That's right. That one.

I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.

I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?

I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?

I never said that.

Okay.

I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?

Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.

Yes, James.

I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.

Ail right. By the way, his friend...?

I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.

Do?

The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.

I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.

It beats 'What's your major?'

Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.

Simple.

Yes.

No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.

About the baby.

Inside.

Over there. In the backseat of the...

Would Walter really press charges?

Dozens. It's very sad.

Oh?

In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.

I know, but sometimes...

It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.

I'm your man.

James is... I don't know...

GRADY Tripp. English Department.

Sara. I'm in love with her.

Sick.

Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.

I -- just want to say I'm sorry.

Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?

That's weird.

Just kidding.

No, I'm going ho --

Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.

Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.

Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.

I like the noise.

When can I see her?

You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.

It's a nice table.

It was a beautiful present.

No thanks.

I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.

When?

Isn't it?

Ask me. Ask me anything.

Birds.

In that birch tree is a nest.

That was terrific.

Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.

It's my bird book.

Robin.

I have no idea.

Then you won't mind if I look around.

I could get a search warrant.

Yeah.

What?

You going to take me on a nature walk?

No.

I have a passionate girlfriend.

'Fraid not.

Apartment's okay.

It gives me headaches.

It sounds like you were banished.

Does he?

Robin, listen to me.

I said the job is okay.

Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.

Bad idea.

Honest? No.

Forget it.

I couldn't say.

They usually tell me.

What is your idea of being normal?

What did you think would happen?

What did you want to happen?

Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.

In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?

All right.

That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.

Me?

People without cars.

Most women wouldn't choose it.

I'm just quiet.

What?

I get that impression.

You're still here.

When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.

Hi.

Yeah.

How many girls did you molest?

What did you do to them?

Walter.

Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.

Sounds like a special guy.

Why young girls, Walter?

Nothing. It's over.

I know.

What odds?

Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?

I think it's a fucking good idea.

Just think about it.

What's it look like?

What's your fucking problem?

Do you want to talk about it?

Yeah.

I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.

Piece of cake, baby.

Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.

How deep's the drop-off here?

Hey, you okay?

Yeah, okay.  Okay.

Not for long.

Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.

No.

Chill out, Lindsey!!

Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.

Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.

Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.

I can't... make it... podner.

Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.

Just checking is out, huh?  How come?

Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?

What's you depth, Cab Three?

It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.

What's the timer set for?

I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...

He's hallucinating badly.

I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...

I'm thirsty.

I'm certainly not going to swim across.

I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...

Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.

But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.

And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.

No.

Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.

I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.

Yes.

I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...

I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?

Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...

But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...

What! Get married?

What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?

So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.

Nothing.

I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?

Tell me once more.

I deserve it.

One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.

Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.

What do you mean by sensible?

But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.

Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.

But why all nudes?

It couldn't be any clearer.

He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.

Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?

Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.

This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?

It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.

What is it?

I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?

I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?

Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.

Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.

Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?

Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?

They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.

There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...

No. The owners are in Australia.

From Panarea. Why?

Yes. Until proven otherwise.

Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...

Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.

Oh, for Heaven's sake.

Agnes...

Who tells you these things?

Yes Mother.

That wasn't me.

Right now?

No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.

In the confessional.

How were you sick?

Did it hurt?

And then what?

Where did the baby come from?

Where'd it come from before that?

Just that... you ask and I'll answer.

Anything.

No.

Not at the moment, no.

Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?

From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.

She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.

Somebody told her.

I don't know.

No.

No, but I can never tell her that.

Yes.

From someone who didn't want to have a baby.

A mistake... it was a mistake...

Everything... I don't have children.

I breathed!

I can't.

... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.

Her headaches.

No I'm not.

I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...

Yes.

But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?

Yes.

Yes.

May I open my eyes now?

We went to chapel for vespers.

I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.

Sister Marguerite I think.

What else?

Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?

I don't know which one 

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?

Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.

Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.

You got to be crazy.

Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.

You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.

You have proof?

When?

Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.

Not any more... now I like chocolate.

How do you survive?

No-one.

She undressed alone... she bathed alone.

Yes.

I haven't a clue.

Obviously there was.

Why do you think that?

How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?

So, someone else could have done it.

That possibility never occurred to you?

And what happened?

It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...

How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...

Then help her.

There's another choice.

Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.

Answers.

Nothing.

Yes.

About what?

Oh God, if only I'd known.

Don't deny it!

All right?

Long, thin and filtered.

Right...

Oh, you've come a long way baby.

Listen to her singing.

Who is he?

She is an innocent.

That's crazy. How could she find out about it?

I'm concerned about her health.

Is it because she's a nun?

Oh, don't be ridiculous.

I left it with her and I went for help.

... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...

Shurrup!

Fifteen and two thirds, actually.

All right, take your hoop and bowl.

Just you?

Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?

Not much cop without 'em, is it?

Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.

Yeah.

The police station.

Aren't you supposed to be in that box?

Ah ... a shamus, eh?

You do - repeatedly.

Ta.

She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.

Have I said something amiss?

I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.

Now what's that supposed to mean?

The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.

Sorry.

Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.

Aye, the big hammer, smashing!

No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.

Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?

We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.

Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?

Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.

What's that mean?

Oh ... I dunno.

Yeah ... what's in it for me?

Have they?

Lip reading.

Is there a fire, then?

What's he on about?

Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!

Don't dramatise.

A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.

You're undressed. Where are your clothes?

Hiding.

Don't be callous.

Aye, before anyone stops us.

Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.

You needn't bother.

You're a swine, isn't he George?

You wouldn't!

Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.

Aye, let's try the dressing room.

Hello.

Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.

What have you heard?

I knew I could rely on you.

Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?

Oh, leave off!!!

Don't exaggerate.

Aren't we ...

It's not my fault.

Well, give a couple of minutes ...

Get knotted!

A proper Aborigine.

Cattle ranch!

Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.

Sandy, scan the whole sky.

Dell, plot our location.

Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.

What's the terrain down there?

Then take her down.

Looks like a derelict.

What is it, I can't --

No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.

Wretched.  What happened to me?

Play it for us, please.

Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.

I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --

Yeah!

It grows on you.

Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.

Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.

Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.

I kind of like it.

Well we better do something.

Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.

How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.

Isn't there some way we can get it off him?

Careful, don't get under it!

What do you mean?

How's Broussard?

Sounds like a rough one.

Oh my God.

What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.

Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 

We're not going anywhere.

I think it's fizzled out.

Hey!  what about the film?

Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?

It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.

You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.

I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.

Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.

Is it armed?

Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.

Sun will be down in a minute.

Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.

Can you see anything?

<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!

Let's let the machine work on him.

The commander normally has first publication rights.

We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.

We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.

About four hours.

Yeah?

Right.  Fire up all systems.

Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?

Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?

Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?

Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!

Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.

Let's take her into an escape orbit.

I guess we open the door and net it.

Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.

What do you think?  Now we go in.

The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.

Right now let's keep it closed.

Yeah... I forgot.

The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.

God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.

Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.

Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.

Oh man...

We're not gonna make it, are we?

Get her on-line.  Now!

Match it!

What's our weapons situation?

Has anybody talked to them?

Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.

About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.

We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.

But...

What?

I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.

What?

What's wrong?

Yeah, I...

It's alright, it's cool...

Uh-huh.

Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.

Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?

Compensate!

Looks like it.

Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?

Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.

Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.

Is that a fact.

Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.

Check out the tent.

Hold on...

Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?

What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.

No!

Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.

Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.

Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...

Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.

I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...

Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.

You could sleep, too, couldn't you?

The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...

Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.

More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.

So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...

She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!

Yes, Addison.

Yes, Addison.

It's the same thing, isn't it?

Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.

We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...

And too many of them are produced.

Amen.

I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-

The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.

We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?

Everything... everything's so funny...

All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...

How childish are you going to get before you quit it?

As of this moment you're six years old...

I get a party, don't I?

So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...

Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!

Nothing, really...

It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.

If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.

You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?

I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.

Don't mix your metaphors.

Margo, let's make peace.

Then what would be enough?  If we were married?

That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.

Hear, hear...

I understand she is now the understudy in there.

I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.

It's only one picture deal.

Of course not.

I'm for it.

When I told you what every young actress should know.

What did you expect - live sables?

I never played Fort Sumter.

Of course!

Oh, brother.

You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...

I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...

Just because you can't even work a zipper. It was very thoughtful, Eve, and I appreciate it-

Like an agent with one client.

My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?

You were just looking around...

I don't care if I never get home.

My husband...

I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-

Of course.

I won't forget.

They certainly don't waste much time.

I don't intend to be.

Thank you, Karen.

There are other plays...

San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.

Well - if I'm not in the way...

Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...

Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...

There's the script to go back to the Guild-

Hello, Miss Channing.

Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"

You've what?

The heave-ho.

Roughly ten minutes.

Three or four miles...

Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?

Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.

Lloyd says it's a publicity release...

You'll be there, won't you.

In a minute...

Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-

- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...

Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...

Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.

I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.

Nothing much. She apologized.

Twentyish. It isn't important.

The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.

Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...

We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...

Go ahead, please...

I just played it.

Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...

How about me what?

Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.

An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...

But what could she do?

Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?

I didn't hear you.

Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!

Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.

Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.

I never scared anyone before.

And I'm a Republican.

Sure.

When?

You want me to be the bastard.

--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--

Who?

It's nothing personal, though. 

--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--

--Howard Hunt?

Chapin did contact you then?

--there's nothing new in it--

Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.

You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?

Give me your checkbook then.

Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.

...No... never in so many words...

Which people?

Who were they?

We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.

--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.

--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--

Go on.

He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--

--he went to her apartment and he told her--

Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.

...you're definitely doing a story...?

That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.

I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.

Who?--be specific. How high up?

Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.

--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.

I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...

Security consultant.

No.

--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?

Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--

--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--

According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."

Absolutely.

--can we use their names?--

I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?

--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.

As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.

When so ordered.

Of course--everything they asked--

Thanks coach.

Suck me...beautiful?

You need some work, buddy!

...okay...

Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.

Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?

I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?

Pardon me?

Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.

Of course, I didn't --

Neither will I.

Yeah, me too, okay, cool.

No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.

Give me a break, you're so full of it.

How did you know I was here?

You talked to Stifler?

What?

I'm not playing.

No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.

Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?

Well...I'm pretty sure I've --

Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.

Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.

Yeah, I'm the best, baby.

Yeah, that's right.

No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.

Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.

Come on, Jim.  Where are you?

He's going in!

She's already on a plane back home.

These are for you.  From father to son.

Do you know about the clitoris?

Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.

I told you.

Don't you want me to?

So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?

Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.

Perhaps you can help me with my studies?

Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.

Uh...yeah...sorry.

God dammit, Stifler!

Kevin, this is serious!

Just a second!

No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.

I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?

Me too.

I don't know.  How do you?

What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.

Qualify for what?

Once, in church, dude.

I'm such a loser.

I don't care.

Exactly.

Uhh! Would you die already!

Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...

You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.

What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.

Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?

What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?

Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.

Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.

In an underground club? I'd like to see that.

You must get out of here. It's not safe.

Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.

Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.

I'll be right back. Stay put.

Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.

Are you okay?

I didn't know he had a wine cellar.

Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.

I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...

Yeah. French fries...

It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.

All your weapons, on the floor! Now!

Really.

What?

You too.

FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!

It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!

Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

Bullshit! You're bluffing!

And you call me a moron...

Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.

Oh shit... No...

My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.

Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...

You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?

Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?

I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -

No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.

Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.

Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.

Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.

Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.

You fucking liar!

Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.

Yes sir.

Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.

You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?

How to read.

It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .

But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!

Well, I don't have any money . . .

She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to

Yes, your highness.

Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!

Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!

Trying... to... breathe...

No!

You are the Princess.

Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?

No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!

Anya... where are we?

Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...

Bartok... a question.

What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?

Shut up!

We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.

"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.

Watch me.

STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.

Young	man, I...

Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.

You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?

This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?

M'mm.

Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.

Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.

Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?

Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.

Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.

M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.

What-what-what-what's the matter?

Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.

Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.

Hey, that was last year.

Oh, no, I have a car.

Yeah, well, I'm, but I...

Oh, I'm in her acting class.

No, Chippewa Falls.

Okay.

Yeah, I know.

I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?

Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.

Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.

Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...

Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.

Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.

Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.

No, so help me.

Really?

Oh, all right.

Okay. Yeah.

Oh. And your first wife was Allison?

M'hm.

Oh, yeah?

Do I love you?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.

It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.

That place is four hundred dollars a month?

It relaxes me.

No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.

Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.

No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-

It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.

What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.

David? You call your teacher David?

Oh, yeah? How'd it go?

Yeah?

Sinatra?

Whatta you mean? Me?

I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.

No.

Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.

Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?

Oh, don't go, okay? Please.

Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.

Oh! My God! 

Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?

Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.

Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?

Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.

I thought just earplugs.

Oh, yeah?  Terrific.

Why are you so hostile?

No jokes-these are friends, okay?

"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."

Oswald and ghosts.

The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.

Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.

Key word here is "indulgent."

What are you depressed about?

Oh, do yuh?

I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.

Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.

We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.

But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.

Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.

I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.

We're gonna operate together.

Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.

You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.

His wife has diabetes!

Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.

Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.

Oh, you remember her, Annie.

No.

I just have time to get the, uh-

Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.

I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.

I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.

Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.

A long time.

You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.

You're fucking desperate.

Absolutely not.

Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.

The camera loves her.  A great actress.

Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?

Who, Sally?

Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.

Scratch the two, write in a four.

Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?

It's alright, isn't it?

Not this time.

How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.

You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.

I...wait, what are you talking about?

He's allergic.

Didn't I say?

Borrow whatever you like.

You want a Tylenol, or something?

You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.

Really.

So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.

Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.

Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?

Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...

I love you, Joe Therrian.

Lucy overdosed.

Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.

A perfect night.

Hm.  We should do it again.

Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?

Anytime, sport.

Fantastic.  Out here.

I adore him.

Beats a lawsuit.

I'm ready.

Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?

You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.

Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.

I'm going to throw up.

I'll say as little as possible.

And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.

Who'd like to go and find Otis?

Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.

Truce?

Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...

Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.

Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.

Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.

Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!

DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.

Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.

Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.

Sally, for Christ's sake.

I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?

I have no idea who you are.

Everybody hates the messenger.

Me too.

Oh, Sally Mae...

Don't be silly.

Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?

God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?

Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?

In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.

Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.

Uh-huh.

No you're not.

What?

I'm sorry.

Come here.

I'm so sorry.

When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...

Well...wow...

They're nothing like us.

There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...

Let's just go home, okay?

Yes.

I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.

Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!

Yeah.

Are you asking me to marry you?

Not enough.

She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.

Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.

I didn't hear me say tonight.

I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.

I never like to talk about my work.

Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.

Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.

I hope they're watercolors!

A notch above the storage room.

She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.

Why are you doing this?

But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.

Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.

That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!

Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?

You -- you think I'm right?

Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.

Divinely?

Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.

Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.

General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.

You held onto this all that time?

I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.

A <u>few</u>?

I'm the Princess, aren't I?

Mom!

Barbatus?

Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?

Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...

Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?

Outstanding.  Princess...?

I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!

Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?

Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.

Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?

So...you two are in love?

Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.

I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...

But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?

Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!

Will you introduce me to some worker girls?

Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --

Morning, Miss Kubelik.

Would you like to?

Yeah.

How is your cold?

Nothing.  There are just too many people here.

I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.

I think so.

Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal

I don't understand --

Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.

My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.

Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.

I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.

Baxter.

As soon as I can walk.

They had to pump it out.

He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.

You don't have to entertain me.

Give what up?

Pick a card.

Can I have that pad and the pencil?

As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --

Pick up your cards and let's go.

Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?

For me?

Are you supposed to?

It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.

As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.

It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --

A what?

In the knee?

Are you just making that up to make me feel better?

Cheers.

I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.

For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.

No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --

I'm fine.

Of course not.

What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.

I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.

I don't know.

That's right, Baxter.

Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.

West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --

Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --

You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --

Oh?  Oh!

Oh, you don't have to worry --

You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --

Sir?

And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.

Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.

Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --

You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.

Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --

Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.

All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --

Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --

What does he mean, accident?

Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.

Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --

Oh, I'm very grateful.

What do you want?

What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?

Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?

Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?

I have a vague idea.

Let me get my bag.

Miss Kubelik -- Fran.

Just as long as she's okay.

Sure.

Aren't you?

I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?

I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.

No.

I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.

She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.

Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.

The party's over.

Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?

Who?

Dr. Dreyfuss.

No.

Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.

You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.

I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

You know I liked it better long.

We talked about a lot of things.

Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --

I wasn't trying.

Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.

Are you sure that's what you want?

I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --

It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.

Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.

Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?

All set for what?

Atlantic City?

Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.

You mean you bring other girls up here?

What gives?

Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

See if they'll what?

Yeah.

Well --

We have a lot of pride in our unit --

I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.

Yeah. Way north.

At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?

A long time.

I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.

They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.

I don't believe you --

Probably is.

Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.

Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.

Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.

Where ?

This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.

I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.

When'd you do it?

What is it?

Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?

You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.

Yeah, it still runs.

What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.

Charlie?

Charlie?

I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?

He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.

Well, he's killing now.

Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.

Your daughter.

Thank you, sir.

It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.

Six to eight feet.

Wh -- what?

Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.

No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.

Who knows.

He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.

So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.

I met him.

I'm Kurtz.

What do you mean, Colonel?

You know you're right.

Yeah.

What Truth?

Oh Captain, that is so true.

I'm taking you back.

He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --

Yes, I know...

Both of us...

His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.

Yes I was... He said his last words to me.

He can't kill us.  We're on his side.

Yeah... thanks.

He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.

No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.

Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.

That's me.

What is this bridge?

What did you hear?

Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.

They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.

Right now -- I am.

I do.

I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --

23   CONTINUED:  

Wait 'til I'm across!

107  CONTINUED:

Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.

Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.

134  CONTINUED:  

It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.

I just want this over with.

There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.

Why?

Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.

He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.

I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.

Wait a second.

I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.

-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.

I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.

You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.

I'm here to do my job.

You don't get it, do you?

If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.

You got one?

An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.

Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.

You don't know how true that is.

Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-

Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.

Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.

No, I better stay at my post.

Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!

There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.

What does this matter to you?

Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.

Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.

Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?

We were just talking about him.

Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.

On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.

So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --

Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?

No, I didn't.  So why are you h...

Uh-huh.

Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.

Emergency room only.

No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.

Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.

Will you please take it?

No.

His name?

Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.

What's with the dark?

You all set here?

Are you totally gone? This is my private home...

What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?

My son is sick, okay?

How ya doing?

Note. Put it in the note.

Yes.

I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.

Bettes tells me he's doing fine.

Is there another way to see it?

Dancing?

I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.

Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.

Never.

There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...

This one has a special meaning.

'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.

What a break...

All right, cut me a break.

Don't want to. I love you.

I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --

Two years ago...

Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.

So am I, Frank.

It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.

"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.

If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.

Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.

See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.

No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?

You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.

Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...

Well, that's a load off.

That cleaning woman doesn't...

Come on, sweetheart...

Got any easier questions?

But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.

Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...

What are you talking about?

How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.

The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?

So you're from around here?

What is this?

Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.

No fucking way.

If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.

That's right.

Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.

You're too late.

No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.

What?

Yes, sir.

Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.

I'm worried about you, Robert.

Know what?

I know.  It was a joke.

Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.

Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.

The contract?

Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --

I bet you fucking know!

He stole another contract.

We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'

Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?

'Them'?

Yes.

Yes.

No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.

Rath.  Robert Rath.

As in daughter of Agamemnon?

This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?

He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.

Why not?

They didn't give you a choice, did they?

You said you didn't trust it.

You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.

Here?

Why won't he wait until the bank closes?

Except --

I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.

What?

It can be.

No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.

After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.

When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.

Why?

Martin.

Okay.

Electra --

Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.

I think you're supposed to answer that question.

Honesty.

All the time.

Do you believe that?

That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?

Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?

This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.

An alternative literary venue!

Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.

You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?

Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.

It's big, right Jahn?

I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.

Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?

That makes you an expert I guess.

Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.

Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.

I thought that was part of the charm!

I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?

Thought of everything haven't you.

None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.

Don't we have enough already?

I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.

Yeah, I'll take some.

Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?

Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.

We don't speak Czech!

Who put a bee up your butt?

When your ready Son!

Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka.

No beer?

I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.

Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.

He's lying! I am.

What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?

Good, what's his number?

Sure....Anything else I can do for you?

Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.

Sure I'm sure!

Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!

Okay, but I don't want to miss him.

Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.

Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.

Sure. Excellent.

Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.

Really?

Ooh, well excuse me.

You used to read.

What?

No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.

No, it's not true, you're lying.

Can we charge admission?

Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.

I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?

Deal!

What is bail?

Well she sure isn't normal.

We don't need you.

Thanks.

The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.

Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.

It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.

I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.

No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.

Alright!

Yes, they had nothing to do with it.

That's right.

A kind of freedom.

I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.

I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.

You may use my office.

Yeah.

You don't have fifty foot of apartment!

Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?

No way, he even gave me back pay.

Maybe it is!

Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.

Don't you dare, I'll be back!

The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.

Very well.

I'm sorry about how we --

You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.

-- I like the car I have.

Yeah.

I meant he's a doctor.

I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.

He wants to talk to you.

No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --

I'm just wondering --

York Ave.

Were?

-- Your act only works with an audience.

Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.

So you agree you need help?

Kinda. Yeah.

Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?

It's private.

I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...

And you have to meet my father.

Don't bother!

Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.

That is my telescope.

In 76 years, me neither.

Sometimes I don't even trust me.

I'm really glad you think so.

That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --

Why not?

We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.

What are you talking about?

Fun.

You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.

Twice a year.

Mars.

Sure.

Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --

I don't care.

Yes, one of many.

I'm not applying to college.

I'm sick.

The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.

No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.

I don't want to come here anymore.

I'm not going back to school.

Tired.

Because you have hope that you'll get better?

Up to?

No.

Like what, sir?

Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.

How -- how long does she have?

If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!

I'm not tired.

Yes.

I'm as underprivileged as they are --

You came here to give me my report card?

Yeah.

Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 

I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?

Fine.

Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.

You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?

No!

How are you?

Well... yeah...

You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.

But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!

George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?

Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.

Shhhhhhhh!

Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.

Oh, right, right... 

...To be traveled through

Blast it -- no, I suppose you're right.... You do know the proper chemical formula?

Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.

That's just great!

Well, it was there.

But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!

Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?

Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.

It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...

Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.

87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?

But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.

No way!

What's going on?

Yeah.

They come with the house.

No, he showed me one.

Mmmmm.

They're okay.

Yeah? Why not?

You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.

What?

There you go.

Well, stop the world.

Great.

I don't know.

There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?

I don't care.

But it would hurt.

How bad off is he?

We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.

He was nervous.

Just looking.

Just to keep him out of the sun.

Anybody ever done that to you before?

Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.

Really?

Yes.

Beats me.

New Jersey?

Got a half a tuna sandwich.

And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.

Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!

Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?

I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.

Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...

It?  Who does?

New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.

Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?

Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?

John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.

Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...

Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.

Who?

No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.

You don't wanna know.

She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.

Go where?  Where're you going?

Believe in Penny Priddy?

Sure.  I won't hold my breath.

Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.

Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.

Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.

Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.

Why me?

No!  Ditto the professor-

Please, Barton.

...I know this must look... funny.

He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.

Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.

I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!

I'll bet. Jesus  "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.

Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.

A week, eight, nine days 

...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.

It's still a little early for me.

Well... actually, no Bill...

I said drown 'em all! Who is that?

What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.

Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.

Well I...

Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?

To see pap.

It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.

Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.

Well, you just... sound a little

Okay... a quick one, sure...

Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game  door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.

Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...

Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet  what happened to your ear?

No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...

You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine  you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...

Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.

Seems like nothing but, lately.

Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.

I didn't do this, I did NOT do this

Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.

Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...

Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.

I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.

Lou.

CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings  well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town  but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things  if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool  unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.

You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.

Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.

Yes sir, they 

What 

The others are being sent.

He's a little funny in the head.

Only fry you once.

Mr. Lipnik, please 

Yeah.

When did you start drinking again?

Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.

It's not gonna take long, Sam.

Bring 1976 up.

No.

Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.

I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.

You saw all the reports, Beth!

She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.

What?

Yes.

No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.

No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.

Are you arresting me?

It won't last.

No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.

Yes it does, doesn't it?

That's right.

You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?

Thanks.

You know all about me.

No.  Come in.

I don't know.  But you do.

Do you?

Don't get too cocky.

Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?

What do you want from me, Catherine?

I told you I had a vivid imagination.

I know.

Did you like her to watch?

No.

For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.

Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.

I found Lisa Henderson.

I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.

I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.

What are you researching?

How did it end?

No.

He was murdered.

Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --

Yes I am.

Cocaine.

Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.

I hope I helped you out.

She misses me.

No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.

What is it you got between you?

Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.

I went over last night, too.

That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.

I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.

Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.

Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.

Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.

You're looking for Catherine, not me.

She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.

You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.

It was an accident.

You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?

I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.

Can there be some mistake?

He was shot.

Really. Huh. Too bad.

The whole thing  painting.

Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.

Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?

Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.

What's wrong?

I really think you should talk to him about this.

How about right now?

I hate this. Turn that off.

Decipher?

You mean like an ape?

Out?

Use your fucking instinct.

What's wrong with you today?

Hi Gina.

Come on in!

'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'

I guess you did.

I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!

You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.

Basquiat, what did you take?

You want some?

Staten Island would be ok.

You mean babies with you?

Hi.

That's great.

I'd like to squeeze your titties.

Wanna Mac?

Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?

Can you put me in the ring with him?

What time is it?

"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...

You'll never guess.

Yes, I suppose that we did.

Better than you know, Bat-boy.

Treat to be here.

Yeah?  Me too...

Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.

Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?

Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.

Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --

A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.

I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.

Silent night, violent night...

My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--

Oswald:  We need one more thing.

... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...

Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...

Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.

Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?

Yes?

That, sir, does not compute.

Specify, please.

It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.

Keep it.

Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.

Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.

I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.

No, Robin.  He's going to jail.

He'll be here.

I can make it.

Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.

Definitely.

A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!

She knows who we are.

Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.

Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.

Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.

But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.

I wish I knew.

We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?

Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.

Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?

I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.

I knew you could handle it.

I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?

OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?

You lie!

Adam and Evil.

As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-

The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?

Not good.

Then you never loved me?

Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.

I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...

I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.

Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.

As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.

What?

But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?

Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?

And you are?

I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?

Try a fireman. Less to take off.

My life's an open book. You read?

You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?

Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...

Did Two-Face call him Bruce?

No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.

For _me_? Really? Tell me.

Oh please. You're blind as a bat.

Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.

No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!

Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.

Slanta.

Banzai.

So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?

The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...

I don't get you Bruce Wayne.

You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.

Why do I feel like the other man, here?

I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.

Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-

Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?

I don't want to remember!

Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?

So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.

Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.

Don't bogart that 'trode.

Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.

Miss.

A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.

Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.

Take me. Let the boy go.

I won't let you have it.

Photo database. I'll do your photos now.

That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.

Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?

Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.

I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.

Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.

I'll take you home if you'd like.

I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.

... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...

I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !

... Where are you calling from?

Finding out where she is.

I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.

Ohhhh... You don't mean that.

Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.

What are you talking about?

Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.

Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --

I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.

Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.

Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.

Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.

Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?

Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.

A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?

All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.

Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.

Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.

Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.

It's gone.

Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.

That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."

What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.

I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.

One.

It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.

Meaning?

It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?

Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.

Night.

oh dear.

Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....

Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?

Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.

Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.

Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...

Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.

Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?

Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?

... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.

Quite right, sir.

What makes you say that?

Sure did.

Great, good.

She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.

Yes?

Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!

Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.

Yeah, we should party.

Heh heh. Yeah.

That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.

Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.

Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.

Cool, huh huh.

Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...

Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.

Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?

Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.

Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?

Dill-wad...

Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!

You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.

Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.

Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.

Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?

I see it. I don't get it.

Cut the power!

Deep and hard.

Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.

That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?

Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.

Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.

Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.

Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.

Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.

Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?

Uh, ten uh...

We're rich in what really matters.

Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?

Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.

Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.

Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.

Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.

This is going to take some time.

I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.

I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?

In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.

What's she doing here?

Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...

No, I'm not putting up with this.

<u>You</u> left me.

You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?

Not really...  what's this?

She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.

Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.

Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.

We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --

Of course I did.

I didn't do that one... Hmmm.

The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?

Who did the sushi?

I didn't --

Let's see if she can get my model back.

3:30 I guess.

<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.

God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?

Really.  I don't know.

I got an A!

Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.

D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.

For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.

Can you scare them off?

Now, let's get rolling!

And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?

Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.

I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?

Yes.

No, wait!

It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.

Where'd they go?

I think so.



That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.

He's a cloven-hooved beast!

It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.

Let me have it.

Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.

Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --

... sheets.

Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --

They're ghosts.  They do what they want.

They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.

It wasn't a joke.

Gooood!

Viridian?

Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!

Attic space.

Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.

<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.

Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.

Hold your breath and we'll pull.

That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!

I understand. I've seen it done before.

Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.

Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.

Thank you, Robert.

I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?

Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?

... But he's...?

I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.

Yes, sir.

Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.

No. I'm a gardener.

No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.

Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.

Good night, Eve.

Hello, Eve.

Fine. He's very nice.

... Mentor...?

Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.

Oh, no. She brought me my meals.

Yes, so do we.

So am I, Eve.

No, Eve. I don't read the papers.

Thank you, Eve.

Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.

The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.

Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.

I certainly do.

I see. I would like to work in your garden.

Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.

Oh, I see.

Yes.

I can't write.

What sort of bed is it?

No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.

No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.

Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.

Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!

Yes.

Which view?

Yes. I was there with Ben.

Yes, Thomas - I understand.

Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.

Compensated...?

Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.

Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.

I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...

Yes, I will.

As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.

I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.

Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...

We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.

Gardiner, yes, sir.

No problem, Chief.

Right, Chief.

Right, Chief.

We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...

Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.

Yes, sir.

... Mr. President, how good to see you.

Take care of yourself, Ben.

Mr. Gardiner...

Who am I thinking of?

I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!

Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.

Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.

The monkey.

Hmmm.

She's very beautiful.

Right.

All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.

I'm scared.

I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?

Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.

I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.

Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.

It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. Well smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.

Yes.

We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.

Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.

What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.

Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.

I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."

The iguana?

No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.

Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.

Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.

How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!

You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.

You married?

My tits?

Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.

Well, I'm a puppeteer...

You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.

You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.

Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?

Good. We'll sell tickets.

I'll protect you, Dollface.

Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!

Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.

How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.

J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...

Ha ha ha!

I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?

Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.

Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.

A scary dream?

I like that.

Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.

Gehginnis ondah foam?

Think, Jew florist?

Says who?

You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?

You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.

Do we get to wear a crown?

Count me in.

Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?

My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.

Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.

Why not? I need to get in there!

Yes, Hi.

I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?

I have to see you.

I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.

Did you see the reviews?

We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.

Yes, Maxine, yes.

Oh, Lotte...

I can explain about the portal, darling.

Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?

I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.

Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.

No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.

Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!

It's okay, my sweet.

Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...

I've got to leave Malkovich.

Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.

Whatever.

What want ye, girl child?

There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..

That's the last thing they took from me.

YOUR FACE IS MINE.

Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.

That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..

No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..

No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.

At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.

I don't. I have my own.

Thank you.

May I come in?

I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.

Oh.

In case of what?

Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?

Extra?

I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.

Mama?

That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.

Might see anything at all at 124.

He's sleeping in the church.

Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.

Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!

Aw, no, Ella.

He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.

You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.

If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 

Just me.

Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.

She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.

You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.

Paul D.

She was my best thing.

Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?

You're not dealing with morons here.

Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.

Uh-huh.

Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.

You don't know shit, Lebowski.

Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?

Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.

Zere ARE no ROOLZ!

Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.

Walter, how--

I'm going home, Donny.

So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--

That fucking bitch!

I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.

Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.

You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--

We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.

Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.

Hey, is this him with Nancy?

I see.

Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--

And the, uh, the briefcase?

Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.

Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.

Does the Pope shit in the woods?

In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.

I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.

Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.

Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.

No it's fine, really, uh--

Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?

Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.

Mmnun.

Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.

It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--

Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--

Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?

Okay. That, uh.

Huh?

First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.

Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!

MARK IT ZERO!

Well, just take 't easy, man.

Yeah.

What if it's during a game?

Huh?

Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.

The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?

My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?

It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--

What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?

Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!

Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!

Walter, please--

What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--

For Christ's sake, Dude.

And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?

They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--

What about the toe?

All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.

Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.

Not if I have anything to say about it.

Not exactly a lightweight.

Look, man, did you--

And the fucking money!

Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.

AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!

No Dude.

A hundred and eighty dollars?!

Walter--

Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!

Dude, I'm sorry--

It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.

You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.

But I do work, so if you don't mind--

Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!

Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?

No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.

Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.

Where's the money, Lebowski?

Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!

Impressive.

He's half yours, partner.

Someday.

He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.

From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.

You don't have to hunt to do it.

For what?

I wouldn't read too much into it.

I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.

Not good.

Did you think I wouldn't?

Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.

Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.

Where the hell have you been?

Why don't you ask your girlfriend?

Then who does he work for?

I should think that would be obvious at this point.

Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.

He was here.  Watching us.

He wants us to know he's hunting us now.

Getting your attention, Paco.

Two so far.

Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.

Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?

So how long have you known Blade, anyway?

I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take "E", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"

Are we bringing home strays now?

You should've killed her, then.

Just do it, old man.

Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.

Pass.

It's because I'm human that I can do this.

"The Blood Tide".

How do I stop it?

You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.

Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.

Some. It's been slow --

I don't know. I woke up just before you did --

I'm not leaving without you.

The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.

What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.

So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?

What happens if he doesn't take the serum?

He killed them?

I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.

I don't...I don't understand them myself.

A coward too. That's why she had to go.

--my God, Nick???

Sometimes. Where are we going?

I just wanna go <u>home</u>.

--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.

Let's talk to your husband--

Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.

Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.

She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.

Not the only things missing, Nick.

--Nick!!

What?

--whatever; that's her.

Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.

--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?

It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.

You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.

Yes.

--bullshit!

--Cotter's--

--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--

Yeah.

I can't.

I can't let you in.

Sometimes.

Turn the tapes back on.

Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.

--fuckin' A right--

I do.

So where the hell am I going to sleep?

Ask me what I don't have.

Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.

Su casa y shit-o hole-o.

My room, asleep, last I checked.

Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!

No idea--goddamitt!

Down there in the Park.

--I don't know.

--who?

I am.

I'm not finished.

<u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.

No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.

Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--

Spite.

--oh, Jesus--

--still go see the OB in the morning--

Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.

Ah, Domini?

At least you still have the tapes.

--no.

Then I have no idea.

Motion. Stop there. Play it again.

They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.

I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.

Domini.

--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.

You're needed here--keep watching--

Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.

What happened to my Dad??

Yes.

I am?

Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.

No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--

Sort of...

Yeah.

Your husband.

I just gotta see a guy.

...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.

...You ever get tired?

Abby--

What the hell happened, Ray?

What do you want to know?

With your gun?...

Remy.

I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.

See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.

What?

Lubbock?

Uh-huh.

Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.

I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?

No.

Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.

I didn't say that.  Well?

What do you think?

Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.

So it would seem.

Of course.

You said the usual--

Right.

Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.

Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.

Meurice...

No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?

I'm not sick.

Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.

Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.

Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.

Yes?

Yes.

Yeah.

I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.

No. not at all.

Yes sir.

If you want to.

Oh he forced you, huh?

Jeffrey.

I wanted to see you.

Then don't talk about killing.

Don't say that.

Yeah. hurry up though.

There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.

Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?

I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.

Frank is coming?

Sure I do.

Kiss me.

There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.

Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!

I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.

Terrible. boring.

That's too bad.

Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 

Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.

My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.

Still, it must be kinda rough.

Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.

Yes and no. Did you recognize him?

I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.

Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.

Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.

Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.

Look. it can wait till Sunday.

Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?

It's okay. Don't worry about it.

Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?

Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.

That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?

I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?

Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?

No.

What is it?

Nothing. really! It's good to see you.

... You look beautiful.

No.

Dorothy Vallens?

I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.

Do you want the car?

Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?

No. No thank you.

Yeah. okay.

Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?

Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.

I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.

Um-hmm.

What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?

My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.

He what?

That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?

Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?

Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.

You happy, baby?

I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.

Yeah, I don't feel so well.

Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.

Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.

What?  Yeah, sure.

Excuse me?

We want some grass.

You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.

Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.

Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.

No fucking way.

What?

You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?

Slow down, George.  Slow down.

Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.

Okay.

We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.

And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?

Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...

Just a friend.

Try the closet.

You're a lucky man, Diego.

Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.

You went behind my back and you cut me out.

I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.

Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.

Take your boots off.  You're tan.

Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.

Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.

It's beautiful.

Yeah.

Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.

Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.

No.

That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?

What do you guys want?

Figured what out?

Tuna.

Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?

I don't think so.

I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.

I like fire.

Out.

Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.

Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.

My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.

Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.

Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...

You mean, like a trip?

California.

Where are you going?

I know, Dad.  I love you too.

Okay, George.

We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.

Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.

Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.

Very nice.  I'll take it.

I don't need a little.  I need a lot.

This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?

Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.

And you believe the NLF?

The NLF has condemned you to death.

You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.

C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.

Then don't complain.

Let's try ...

I think it'll be a success ...

Why?

Good evening, sir.

Good evening, sir.

Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...

You got something on the Coke?

Thanks, Mister D.

Did I say it was a natural death?

That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.

What'd he die of?

The official cause?

We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.

Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.

It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.

Yes.

Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?

Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.

You may call your next witness.

Sit down, Frank.

Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.

Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?

Back off, John.

The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.

You get his statement?

I have.

No.

That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.

A little after eleven.

I had some papers to pick up.

No -- but I can get it for you.

No -- never.

Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.

For about one year.

Intense.

It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.

It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.

What did she say?

I woke up the next morning and she was gone.

At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.

She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.

We had dinner at a restaurant.

No.

Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.

She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.

Yes.

Chinese peony root.

I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.

Yes -- he did.

He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.

Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.

No.

He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.

So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.

What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.

Why'd you come here?

I'll have you out in a few hours.

No pain, no gain?

Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.

It's not my taste.

Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.

I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.

Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.

She's mistaken.

I went out on the boat.

Paley could be a problem tomorrow.

Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.

I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.

I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.

Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see you right away.  I've got the tape.

The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.

-- But it's Sunday.

Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?

I'm always open to learning new things.

We're supposed to go to the lake.

Yeah -- but can she cook?

Yes.

Why did you lie to me?

No.

Talk to me.

You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.

Sorry.

We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.

Then we should have had lunch at the bank.

SO!

No treasure maps, huh?

Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.

Michael.

Come here a minute.

That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 

That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.

Well, what am I supposed to think?

No. We're going to lock this up and --

What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -

They got heat in Michigan.

Heat is heat.

Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.

Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.

You want me to call the doctor?

Hmm-mmm.

No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.

Want another cigarette?

Francesca.

No, your kids.

Must be nice having kids.

Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.

You get used to it.

Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.

No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.

I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.

What made you ask such a question?

I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.

No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.

Yes! Hi.

No. I was just... No.

No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.

Yeah. See you later.

I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.

Oh, how is he?

Couple. Want to help?

Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.

Yes, that'd be nice.

What?

It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.

I had a temper.

What?

You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!

But now that you have it -

I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.

Hmm?

Apparently just before her death.

WHAT!

You people really don't like dogs.

Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.

Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.

The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.

Take who where?  What you smokin'?

Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.

I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --

Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.

Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.

Or just Hell-adjacent...

But that's your old hood, Pops.

What it will be.

I do alright.  Everybody's happy.

Just try it.

Go on.  It won't kill you.

What?

Hush, baby.

Since we was just grasshoppers...

Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.

But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.

No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.

Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.

Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.

If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.

Back here.  At the end of the block.

Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.

You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.

That's the past.  It's dead.

And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.

That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.

You was just doing your job.

Now you.

Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.

It was just like in my head.

Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."

Yeah, you heard of him?

Not that I remember.

I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.

But the place burned to the ground.

How could that be?  The box was packed!

We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.

Evidence of what?

You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!

Just admit it, Caesar.

The same way you did before.

I think you're fucking crazy!

All part of the business.

What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.

What are you going to do with it?

What are you talking about?

Why?

But it could be anywhere.

No.

The hell I can't!

Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.

You betrayed me!

What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.

I should be going.

Sure, Mickey.  Sure.

Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?

Oh yeah.  Violet!

Leave your phone on the hook.

I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.

...  thank you.

Pretty much.  One day at a time.

Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...

He said you lost something.

Sure.

What do you want?

Maybe.

...  yes.

You have to ask?

Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."

Yes, it is.

Nothing.

I'm not afraid of anything.

I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.

Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?

What the fuck was it?

What was it then?

Sounds like he wanted to get caught.

How much money?

That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.

Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?

He does it right in front of him.

The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.

Waiting in the apartment next door.

When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?

Not Caesar.

Don't be sorry.  Help me.

You are as radiant as ever, Violet.

Violet?

Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.

I thought you were never going to do that.

I'm not asking.

What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?

Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.

We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!

Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...

...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...

...it's a problem...

...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...

What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?

Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.

<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...

It's a lot more stressful than I thought.

Yeah, I know...



One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.

-- sir? --

Excuse me?

That'd be great.

Oh, Jesus... 

Listen to what you want.

That's it?  Is that it?

Looks familiar?

Thanks for the ride.

You got me pretty fucking curious.

...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --

-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?

-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --

-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --

You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.

-- there's no time --

Nykwana Wombosi. 

Go back to the hotel.

If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.

Not really.

I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --

-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --

What?

You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 

-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!

Hang on... 

Enhance it.

-- we're evacuating the building --

Where am I?

I don't know.

What have you done to my flat?

Machines don't fix themselves.

He's tampered with it, Dowser.

... have a look.

Got there!

...Yer nostril?

What? How do you know my name?

Her name is Jill.

On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.

Beginner's luck.

That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.

Well, I ...

Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.

Jack!

What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.

What is it?

Am I?

B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?

What has Tuttle done?

Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.

Why?

Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?

Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?

Do you know what you're doing.

Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.

I do. Goodbye. 

No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.

If you say so.

No.

Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?

A heavy Christmas present.

What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?

Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.

Well, terrorists of course.

Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.

What?

Cut it out, Sam.

Leave me alone!

I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.

Oh ... Jesus!

Your face ... are you hurt?

You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.

Don't worry.

I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!

Next of kin!

All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...

I'll bring it back in ten minutes.

Yes.

Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.

You're not listening, mother.

This isn't rare!

Actually, I've decided ...

Mistake?

He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?

I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?

Thank you for calling Cen -

Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.

Numero, trois.

Central Services.

Fixed?

Have you got one or haven't you?

It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.

What is it?

Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?

It's a 27B/6 of course.

But ... I called Central Services.

... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.

It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.

You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.

I don't think a week's gonna do it.

Pregnant.

She's having a baby. Twins.

Mary ...

He flipped out.

I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?

Did you give Mary something called Red Death?

Dead.

He's going to be all right, right?

What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?

Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.

No, I'd better not.

Even when you say the things, there's always more things.

Yes.

Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.

You look so different.

I think it looks good.

Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?

Maybe I should come up with you.

Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.

We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.

I need to sit down a minute.

He'll be all right.

It'll be a while before he's up and running again.

There's no time.

Frank.

I think the worst is over.

She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.

That's too many.

We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.

Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.

Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.

I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.

Crazy fucker.

Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.

Yeah. Great, isn't it?

It's early for him.

Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.

As long as we keep moving. No standing still.

Who with?

You're crazy.

No shit.

Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.

He's drunk.

You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.

Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?

We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?

There are only ten.

We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.

What?

I'll put her on.

They booted me out of Washington.

Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?

Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?

Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?

I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.

I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.

Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.

I don't like the word gay.

Why do you say that?

Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.

Not because you have to.

Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.

Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?

Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.

Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.

Then it went well.

I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?

No!!!!!

Let me think a second.  It's tough.

Yes, I guess.  Yes.

Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.

Your hair's a little funny.

Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.

It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.

No.

Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.

Oh, come on -- tell us another.

Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.

Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.

I'll be right down.  It's right tight.

I'll never tell.

I spent a fortune on this.

We could...

No stop where he's all besieged.

Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.

Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.

No.  Really...don't worry about it.

Okay.

I'll speak to you.

I don't know.

It's not.

Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.

You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?

Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.

Yes, sure.

Uh-huh.

We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...

You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?

And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?

Yes.

Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.

Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.

Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.

I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?

Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?

Why, you need me for the story?

Oh, good.

I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.

It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?

Who?

Great.

Because you're nuts.

Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.

Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?

I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.

I'll see you at the office.  Good night.

Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.

Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...

How can you say that to me?

It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.

Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.

A picnic?

God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?

I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.

I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.

Yes, I'm sorry.

I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.

What!

Righto.

A thing I made.

Honest?

It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...

Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.

That means you like me!

Just about anything, Walter.

What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.

Hm.

Do you have to be so cold to him?

When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.

Nothing...nothing at all.

Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.

That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.

Not only that, he copied us!

I know, man.

I know, man.

I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...

No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.

I was just looking at Carla's picture.

Well I was uh, just looking...

Well it sure looks dead enough.

Well...

A parakeet?

Have a seat -

You want me to open a window or something?

Yeah and what would I say?

Just wait till you see this!

Excuse me I have to make a call...

I can't talk right now.

Uh, sure.

Yeah I did.

Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.

C-connection?

Telling you what?

Smack?

Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!

I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!

Yes, get rid of them...

Uh, I don't know.

Here here!

Really?

T-turned on?

Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.

I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.

Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.

Well why don't you clean up this dump!

No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.

He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.

Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.

We hate you guys!

Bummer metaphor.

You didn't like them.

You look like shit, Benny.

No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.

Get away from here.

Probably.  What movie is this?

Uum... around ten?

Maybe.

Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.

Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...

It's the news, Buffy.

I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.

I thought we were meeting here.

Didn't you get my message?

I am so sure.

Buffy.

Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.

Water.  Okay.

Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.

I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?

Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.

You say that like it's a bad thing.

See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.

Like my homework.

Kimberly, it's the senior dance.

I forgot.

Yeah, whoops I came.

I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.

I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.

Lothos.

All right.

Our purposes.

Do you know what a Vampire-King is?

Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.

We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.

Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?

All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?

Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.

And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.

Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.

Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?

Good Lord.  What do you study in history?

Oh.

Try to pay attention.

Fine.

I can't work this.

You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.

And where are they now?

He knows who I am!

Cassandra, you gotta come, too.

What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.

Thank you very much.

Nicole...

What's happening?  What do you want?

She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.

Where'd you learn how to do that?

Nee sitch.  No way.

Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.

Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --

He is so bald.

Okay.

Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.

You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.

As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?

I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.

I am.

You can learn to like it.

What?

What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?

If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.

It's all the same thing.

Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.

What a nasty thing to say.

I'm trying to play with your body!

I think I'm ready for the Show.

I got lured.

"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".

Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?

What do you believe in?

When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.

What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,

Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.

I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.

He won't make love to me anymore.

Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.

What's so great about baseball?

It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?

How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?

He looks great, just great!

Oh let's not...

She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...

You need a nickname.

The socks?  It's cold in here.

Never heard of 'em.

No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!

Beg me!

Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.

How?

'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.

A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.

God--what a Big League move.

Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.

Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.

Okay, I'll kick your ass there.

Forget it.

'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-

Love to--

We'll pray anyway.

C'mon big 'un, you're okay...

I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down

Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?

...and one helluva guy.

He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.

Jim looking for somebody.

Looking for Crash Davis.

...he did what he was told.

But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.

What?

I can't believe you're doing this.

Why are you doing this to me?

Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...

It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.

I'm serious. No interference.

Excuse me.

Watch it, partner, watch it!

...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -

Yeah, yeah. I know that.

Hey, little Dale Evans.

I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.

I can't! I'm tied!

What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?

I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -

I don't know.

I don't know.

Matter of fact...

Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.

Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.

If his girlfriend was knocked up.

Hey.

Somethin', huh?

Honey, come here.

You mean, I have your permission?

Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.

And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.

Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.

It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.

You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.

What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...

Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.

Yeah?

Yeah.

...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!

...to me.

I see you, you motherfuckers.

Practice enough this week, you prick?

Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.

Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.

Yeah.

Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.

Well, that's why they paid so well.

Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?

And they were usually right.

Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.

That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.

I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.

Certainly.  Senator.

We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.

Call security.

I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.

Ginger's mission in life was money.

She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.

We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?

I - I - I...

No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.

You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.

I'm not crying. 

Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah.

Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?

But as much as they loved her...

Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.

Yeah.

You can trust me.

No, he didn't.

Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?

What?

That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.

...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...

Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.

...twenty-five thousand?

And...

Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.

Mm-hm.

But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?

Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.

Fuck you!

You're not takin' Amy.

You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.

Oh.  I got your cigarettes.

So, who'd you go to lunch with?

What'd you have?

What did Jennifer have?

Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.

I can back him off.

Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.

Not gonna let me in?

You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!

What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.

Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.

Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.

Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go.

Green?

Can you do it with your left hand?

God! 

And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?

Yeah?

Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?

I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?

Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.

Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.

That's not a problem, that's not a p-

Pitch-black?! It -

...fuckin' jerk-off.

If we let her get a few of her things we'll be out of your hair.

Okay.

Nicky, I did -

Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.

Yeah. Fuck him.

Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?

He's gone?

Carmine's gone.

Carmine left?

Calm down! Calm down!

We can't help him if -

What?

How are you?

I'll take care of it, Remo.

Yeah, I heard, yeah.

I understand.

Ma che cazzo!

Yeah.

But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...

I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -

Am I right?

I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.

He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.

Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.

No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.

Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.

I'll be there.

Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -

Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.

You did. You're right.

A sponsor.

Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.

What about my money?

All right. Be careful.

What's the matter?

She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.

No, I'm gonna drive.

I think that's it.

God, I'm telling you, they're out!

Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?

Boy, look at this place, huh?

All right.

Get up.

What's takin' so long over there?

Stacy. 

Nicky sends his warmest regards.

...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...

But he never talked.

But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.

Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?

You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.

Yeah, what'd you tell him?

Yeah, what's to stop him?

They'll do it.

Dominick said they're in the motel?

Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!

Charlie M.

Hey.

Well, I'm a little confused here.

Denying?

Receipts and bills and... everything's here.

I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.

I'm sorry.

Then do it the way you want.

You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...

Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..

Crowd always buys it. What do we got?

I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.

Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...

Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.

I wonder..

You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..

What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.

I'm sure.

At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.

A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.

Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..

Oh, how long have you had your own route?

Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?

Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?

Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.

Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.

That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.

What did you say?

I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...

I know.

Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?

Men, huh?

The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...

What's the name of your child's best friend?

Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..

Enough.

I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...

Uh-huh..

"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...

Thanks.

You could've made me lose my call.

I didn't hurt you.

He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.

You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.

Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.

Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.

Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.

I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.

That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.

Just like they say; no fucking self control.

Make a "U" and go back.

What do you keep making me out to be?

Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!

What am I supposed to do?

Allow me.

I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?

They're holding my husband downstairs.

They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.

One of them <u>is</u> a cop.

He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --

Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.

I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.

Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.

Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.

Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?

Pictures.

Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.

That makes two of us.

Don't talk.  Don't talk!

Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.

But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?

I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.

Yes.

She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.

As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.

Why pick me to be your "mark?"

L.A.P.D.

I don't hear him moving around anymore.

Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.

Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.

259-7881.

We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.

Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.

We can't leave him to repeat anything.

Only one way to find out.

That's not good enough.

Who is this?

You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.

Some loyalty.

Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.

I wish it had never been invented.

We don't see you.

It's your call.

Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.

My pleasure --

What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.

Better reassure him.

Call me "Nels."

And if you ditch us we get zilch.

The fuck I will!

None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.

Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?

You've got a <u>phone</u>?

Government business?

Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?

From here on, I dish it out.

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

She's not a girl, Col --

What do you think his name is?

Hi, Jimmy.

Persistent.

Ask him yourself.

C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!

You heard me --

Fuck off, Dave.

He wants to know do I mean that.

She's not that either.

Not in my experience.

Guy I work with.

What's it to you?

Scottish?

He's Scottish, Col.

Jimmy?

Not me.

Whiskey.

Tell me about him.

Did you do that to him?

You say that like a gentleman.

He did sometimes.

Want to look after you.

Yeah.

Never said a truer word.

You mean that?

I know that.

Probably.

You can always pretend.

What's her?

Why shouldn't I be jealous?

More than that.

Anything.

I'm sorry.

I'm going home!

I was trying to get out of something.

Jimmy?

Stop it, Dil --

Let them come then.

I like you, Dil --

I promise.

Please, Dil --

Can't.

Yes.

What do you mean?

No way, Jude. I'm out.

Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.

And what if you don't?

Yes?

Some judge...

I told him.

Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.

Right.

Am I?

My pleasure.

Nope. Not handsome at all.

Do what?

I'm talking about your people, not you.

And you know the funny thing?

I didn't even fancy her.

What?

Suppose you could say that.

Don't I know it.

Best game in the world.

The fastest.

Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?

'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.

Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.

We got simple tastes, you and me.

What do you believe in?

Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.

Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?

I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.

Stop that talk now --

The fastest.

Tell me, Jody

The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.

Is there a Mrs. Canfield?

It's all right -- look.

Relax -- you're gaining.

I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.

It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!

Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.

Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!

Then who did? You're the only one left.

Can I really believe you this time, Adam?

Here, give it to me.

And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.

May I have a sandwich, please?

So that was it.

Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.

But it's Charles's money, not theirs.

But I don't have it.

Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!

You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!

Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.

Were you followed?

Who?

Describe him.

By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.

No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.

1944. The next face, please.

The last one, please.

When did you see him -- what time, I mean?

Yes.

Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.

I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.

I met a man with sharp nails.

It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?

Would you like to see where I was tattooed?

Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!

Yes, but we're divorced.

Cutting it out.

You did.

Oh. 

I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.

I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.

Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?

This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.

I dare you.

Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.

Shut the door!

Fiction or non-fiction?

Well!

You mean, you're a thief?

And if it is?

You know I'd tell you if I had it.

Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.

Tell me what?

Stop it!

I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?

Leave?

Swiss.

He didn't have one.

I don't know.

I don't know.

And this?

-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?

I found it! I found it!

No, Jean-Louis.

A man traded with me -- all those for only four.

It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?

Why, do you think we're going to?

Quitter.

I'm afraid you're blocking my view.

I'm Regina Lampert.

Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.

Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?

Charles sold it all -- at auction.

No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!

I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.

How about once more around the park?

Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.

That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.

Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.

Don't put yourself out.

Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --

Ça alors! From Charles?

Didn't Charles have any friends?

I've never seen him before.

The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --

Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.

Who invited you?

He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.

I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?

That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?

I get the imports.

The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?

Daddy you scared me!

Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!

Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.

Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?

I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.

Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!

No I wasn't.

There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.

I can.

I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.

I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.

Yeah. You should check downstairs.



Who's?

Jesus. Any word from Brent?

Can you just follow me? The back is full?

You know about that too?

Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.

Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?

I don't watch him eat everyday.

You eventually have to talk to him.

FINE. Are you?

Ok.

Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?

Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.

Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.

I'm not using him as an excuse.

Just making me feel like a piece of meat.

Sharon's far from a slut.

What?

Hi princess.

Yes?

Attacked how?

The men. Do any of them still live around here?

You're not telling me something.

Are you Jody?

Ok.

Told you to hide it.

If sheep don't count.

I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...

Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...

So far, ye-yes.

Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.

Your fellow hero, untouched...





Where's Elvis?!



You'd never understand!

Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...

All right, let's move...

I will tell you what I...

Excellent.

And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...

 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 

There's only one way you can do it, Mason.

 No...

Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.

Everything will die, Mason.

 The only one who understands what this me-...

Yeah, yeah...

We've got the real thing!

Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.

Do you recognize this young man?

INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.

Heat's murder.

A ruler?

I said horseshit.  Horseshit.

What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.

Who's the investigating officer?

Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?

That's too bad.

It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.

Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.

When was the last time?

How did you find out?

Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?

I have no idea. How much do you want?

The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.

Either that or she'll be in jail.

What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.

I think I'll kill her.

Call me Jake. How is everything?

Curly, where's your car?

Where's that?

Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.

Okay, you got yourself a boat.

Jake, listen.

Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?

You mean that's what you're going to call it.

Too late for what?

Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.

Yeah.

I guess not.

Gee, thanks, Lou.

Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.

Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.

A private investigator?

I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.

Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.

Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.

You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.

Looks like you went quite a distance.

I'll stop by.

Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.

Well, how much would you like?

How did you find out?

Did he know?

That your maiden name?

No. I'm just a snoop.

More like other people putting their business in my nose.

Another satisfied client's wife.

Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.

Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.

For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.

Of course I'm sure.

What dam?

The Valley?

Jasper Lamar Crabb?

I gave everybody the night off.

What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?

What were you doing there?

Doing what?

Your eye.

He owns it. You know?

I am not!

You mean she just found out?

You won't go to the police if I tell you?

Aren't you coming back with me?

...That's not what I meant.

Where's the girl?

Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?

What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.

What the hell is this all about?

I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...

She's my sister.

She's my sister and my daughter!

He didn't wear bifocals.

But, Mr. Gittes.

Yes, Mr. Gittes.

Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.

Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?

Oh no.

Of course.

Oh, good.

Yes...

Well, no.

What about the water?

When it comes? What'd you tell him?

But I have to know.

May I ask what this is regarding?

He was expecting you?

Yes. No.

Yes.

Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.

Yes. Yes, they were partners.

All she needed for that was the phone book!

No, you have a press agent do it.

So I can have these? 

Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.

Toto, come here.

Come in, Alfredo.

It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.

No. And nobody knows where she is.

Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 

Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...

I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...

Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.

What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.

No...

They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!

What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!

Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...

How are you, Mr. Thatcher?

The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.

I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!

Oh!

From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.

You know why?  She was so -

Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -

Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 

Yes.



September the ninth?

I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?

Yes, Mr. Bernstein.

Mr. Kane is finishing it.

Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.

Ask them to sit down.

How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?

That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.

Yes - Mr. Kane.

There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?

I'm surprised he got the votes he did.

There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -

But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.

I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?

I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!

You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.

On the chiffonier.  Here.

I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.

You really don't know who I am?

And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?

Oh, me -

I didn't say.

Well, I -

Oh, no, that's all gone.

You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -

You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.

You're my wife, Susan, and -

No, you're not.

- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.

It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -

Thanks.

Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.

If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 

I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.

Can you prove it isn't?

He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?

What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -

People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.

But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.

Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.

- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.

What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"

Go ahead.

That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?

Why, Brad?

Why is she leaving me?

Are you finished?

You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -

It's simpler than that, Brad.  A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -

Yes.

You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.

You won't be lonely, Charles...

Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.

Was he in love?

That must have been love.

Sure.

All we saw on that screen was a big American -

But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -

Well, thanks a lot.

Millions - if anybody wants it.

Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.

She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.

Rosebud?

This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?

You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.

No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.

You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.

We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!

What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!

Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?

He went home to change for the big date.

No, this is great.

Just now.

Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?

So you're really getting married?

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

Tell me I don't have something to do with it.

You lie.

I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.

Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...

Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.

Sang.

I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.

What happened to the walk and the nakedness?

It wasn't me.

We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?

I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.

Oh God...

Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?

Excuse me?

In a second!

Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.

I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.

To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?

So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?

What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.

Why are the shutters closed?

Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?

Your mother.

You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fiancé.

Blasphemy.

Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.

There's more?

This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.

Each egg has to be perfect.

Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.

He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.

I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.

You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?

Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.

Let's hear it.

Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...

Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!

I know.

Gatorade.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?

She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.

Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.

An embarrassing way to die.

That's embarrassing?

Reach what?

I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!

You work in a video store!

Not yet. 

I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.

I'm not.

Watch the store while I go home and change.

No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.

Why do I have this life?

I was born.

I should shit or get off the pot.

As if it's that easy.

Oh, like your life's any better?

You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.

What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.

Thanks.

What time did you get to work today?

You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.

Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.

You need a ride?

Helluva day.

THE GLADES MOTEL?

Excuse me?

I didn't strain. I sighed.

Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.

Done poisoning the youth for the day?

One seventy-nine.

So.

He died in the bathroom.

I don't know. I wasn't watching.

Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.

We were going to start again, I think.

So I'm told.

No, he got hit by a bus.

Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.

No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.

Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one.

I hate this fucking place.

Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.

Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!

Somebody jammed the locks with gum.

Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.

She called you, didn't she?

Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.

Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.

These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.

Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?

I want you to come with me on Monday.

To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.

After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.

Why do you say that?

Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...

Something like thirty-six.

And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!

Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?

I don't want Caitlin...

What?

WHAT?

You said you were here all day?

The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.

He's your cousin?

No way.

Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.

Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.

I hope it feels good.

Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.

You're not?

Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?

Which one?

Do you still talk to Sylvan?

Bye. 

C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!

What?

That woulda been cool.

They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.

I copy.

Where's the radio?

Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?

Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.

Hey, fuck you.

Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!

When we get this group down, I'm gone.

I did what I thought was right.

And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!

You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.

Is it really four thousand?

Sure you can.

Nice and easy...

The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.

We spent a night there one night...

Don't believe it...  You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.

On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?

I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.

I don't expect you to understand.

Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--

--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...

Maybe lead to a flare up...

From one professional to another, of course.

Jess--you look good.

He can handle it.

Can't do it.

I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.

You attacked me.

Yeah?

No, not really.  Throw down a rope.

Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.

Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.

RUN, DAMMIT!!

Right, all the bullets we can eat.

Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.

Half a day.

Who's going with you?

On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.

Kill him when he gets down.

Then go fetch.

Richard Travers.

You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?

I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.

For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.

You bastards... bastards.

Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.

I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?

Try the wine!

Won't you join me, sir?

Thank you, sir.

... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.

I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.

I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.

Alex.

Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.

Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.

I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.

That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.

Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.

Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.

Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.

Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?

You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.

Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.

There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.

Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.

Alexander de Large, sir.

Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!

Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.

Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.

Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?

What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?

I just say what the other person would say?

That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.

I'm sure it won't be long now.

Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.

That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.

They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.

You have, my son.

I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?

It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.

Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.

Amen. They cross themselves.

Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?

Sir.

Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.

Four in this block, sir.

No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.

Thank you.

No.  I got lucky with the lights.

Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.

Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.

This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...

Travel...and things.

You psychic?

Bottega.

Big case?

Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...

I'm...fine.  Fine.

Then let's have it.

I don't know...

What thing?

No harm done, ma'am.

Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.

Try?

I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.

What happens if you don't?

Who is this?

Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>

I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...

Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.

Oh.  Sorry.

Yeah, yeah, sorry...

An apology.

Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.

I'm cool.

The trunk?

Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!

It's a mess.

They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.

What'd he do to you?

What?

I listen to classical.

You mind?  I'm working here.

No.

I'm done.  Find another cab.

<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>

Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?

Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?

Oh, I'm captivated.

Don't start.

I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...

Doesn't cover everything.

I don't get it.

He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?

We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.

No, not just that.

Some living.

Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?

Let her go.

Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.

So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?

Motive?

I think you're different.

You bit someone's nose off?

For what?

That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.

Nothing is easy.

Six months.  Eleven days.

You're certifiable.

Um, coffee.  If that's okay?

This would be it?

Who?

Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.

It was that painting.  The one on the wall.

Not this again.

Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.

They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.

So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.

Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?

What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.

If that's what you want.  Yes.

What?

Those are song lyrics, Jerry.

Jerry, I --

If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.

Did you kill my father?

I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.

Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.

Because he believed me.

They'll trace it.

Where are you?

It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.

Top pocket...  Go on.

You've never seen her run.

Then I can't be hurt anymore.

Well, I don't know if --

You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?

I'm sorry.  What was the question again?

A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?

Only on the football field.

Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.

You do recognize it then?

Working.

What do I look like to you? Switzerland?

Tell me about it.

I was just thinking that.

You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.

He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?

I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.

I'm willing to take that risk.

You're --

Oh?  How's he doing?

Goddamnit, they are out there, David --

I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.

We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.

Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.

Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.

Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.

How soon will you be able to decode it?

Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...

Well --

Analyzing signal polarization shifts.

I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.

It's beautiful.

You want to classify prime numbers?

In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.

Is it possible.  Yes.  But --

Because I can't.

I can't move any smaller.

On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.

Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...

Small moves, Captain, small moves.

Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.

The librarian... or the library...?

Now... you go home.

If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.

But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.

Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --

No.  Please.

I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.

A page-break signal.  A period.

That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.

That's my girl.  Done.

Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.

-- of Hadden Industries.

It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?

What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?

Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.

Ellie --

Peter.

You too.

And where exactly does that put your position...?

You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?

In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.

Something like that.

I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.

It's late.  We should go back.

An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?

What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'

I'm sorry.

And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.

It was quite a page turner.

I'm not sure it's come to that.

Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.

Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!

Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --

How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?

But --

I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.

Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.

What are you doin' here?

Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.

Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.

Yeah. Come on out, Luke.

Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.

Git to work!

She's got him! You hear that?

Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.

I'll give you fifty cents.

I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --

Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.

I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?

Look, she's got paint on her toenails! Oh Lord, whatever I done, don't strike me blind for 'nother couple minutes. Oh you Lucille!

He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...

I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.

Get away!

I just always did like truck rides.

Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.

That's what you're gonna have to do.

The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.

Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.

You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.

Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.

We ain't goin' nowhere.

Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.

Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.

No more than five. For a cold drink.

Kick a buck.

That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.

He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.

What are you talking about?

Only kidding!

A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.

Andy?

I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.

I know.  Do come and meet your guest.

Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...

Tell her about <u>what</u>?

'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.

What pattern was that?

You already made the delivery?

She don't want it.

Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.

You come and visit.

Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.

Is he out?

Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.

For months... last October.

He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...

That's no surprise.

Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...

That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.

Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...

Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.

This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.

It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.

They get fan letters...

Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.

Well, thanks.

Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.

He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.

Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.

Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...

I'll get a locksmith.

Yes.  I have to go...

I know, baby.  I know.

She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.

Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.

Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.

Just horseshit luck.

Yeah, but she had divine guidance.

You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?

You came in there with this attitude...

Helen... excuse me, we...

The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.

That's always your privilege, sir.

I know.  Get out here.

You're damn right I do.

I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.

Helen Hudson...

Because I think I'm wrong.

What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...

Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.

You got a suspect...

So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.

In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.

They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.

It is?

Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.

I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.

I work in the immigration department there.

I can drive.

Yes.

It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.

What?

Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 

I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.

OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.

Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.

Really?

She said she'd be here at 10.

I'd have to see it on.

You look beautiful.

Truly.

Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.

Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.

Ecru.

I ruined your wedding night.

Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.

Come on.

Paul could pop the question at any time.

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?

I'm glad.

Terrific.

Anything interesting.

Good God.

And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.

Really?    Me too.

Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.

I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.

I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.

I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.

I better make a list.

Sounds grim.

No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.

Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.

What do you want to do?

You should go.

It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?

Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.

I mean tonight.

Oh, ok.   Maybe.

No, it's not like that.

Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.

You just need to get more organized. L

So, I've been thinking a lot...

I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.

I've met someone else.

It doesn't matter who.

I heard your friend was back in the hospital.

Office work?

That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.

Do you know who this is?

You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.

Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.

They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.

Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.

Where did they go?

What?   This?

You're there now?

You're calling me on your cell phone, right?

What?

You don't trust me?

Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.

Good.   I'm good.

I'm good.   Really.

I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.

I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.

Supernumerary. It means better than expected.

Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?

You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.

Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.

How about if I call you?

If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.

You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.

I'm not any closer than you are.

Where are you from?

We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.

I'm trying.    It doesn't work.

Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.

It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.

No.

Good idea.

Can I trust you, Sami?

I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.

Man, I can get anything.

-- Did you set it up?

Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.

Hard to say.

You said don't do it, boss.

Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.

Good song though.

Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.

I was told to take what we have and go.

And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.

C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.

This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.

Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.

Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.

Yeah, I can see that.

It's my idea.



Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.

He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.

Uh huh.

It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.

I know where she went.

Wait here.

It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.

He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?

Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.

Something like that.

No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?

No.

That's why we're only breaking one arm.

You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?

You gonna forget about the money I owe you?

I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.

Why were you spying on the Yus?

This Jade Fox is a woman?

I do as I please.

Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.

That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?

Don't bother.

So what if I don't?

I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?

She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.

Don't invite danger into your father's house.

Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.

I have a guest.

You're probably right.

You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.

Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.

Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.

She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.

Spare your energy.  I'll be back!

Not another lecture!  On guard!

By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

Perhaps.

What about you?

I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.

I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...

Father!

Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.

Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?

Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.

Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.

You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?

No onions?

Annie, I need a file.

How 'bout the morgue?

I told you you're not supposed to come in here.

Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!

No.

I have to go.

She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.

And she'll be alive.  Up here.

You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.

I'm looking for a good guitar man.

You don't even remember...

Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.

T-Bird?

Magic.

Interested?  Follow the crow.

Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,

This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.

Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.

No shooting.

I'll be fine.

Excuse me?

Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.

You didn't show it to anybody?

Is there a mutual feeling between you two?

Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.

Junior.

No.

Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?

Why are you being so dramatic?

What? Another letter from your friend?

You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?

I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.

I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.

Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?

Who?

Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.

Without question.

What are you doing?

I'm doing some volunteer work.

Oh please.

I do not.

What are you saying?

Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?

Schwarz. Jewish?

Doesn't ring a bell.

I'll see you tomorrow.

You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.

I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.

Why?

You'd do that for me?

Something awful happened last night.

If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.

I don't know.

Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.

You promised to let me kiss you.

For the first time, yes. It'll pass.

What, nervous I'm going to win?

Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.

I told you to lock the door.

You told her I never said I love you before?

I told you I don't know.

Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.

But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.

It's Kathryn.

No.

It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.

Outstanding.

What?

I see your point... though why should I care?

Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.

It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.

Be more specific.

I'm working on it.

Okay.

Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.

I hate it too.

Have you succeeded in your task?

Well, let me know when you do. Until then.

What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.

Yeah.

Mock, mock, mock.

I've never done this before.

Thank you. Now, where were we?

Come again?

I think you have your answer.

I'll do my best.

I hope I didn't keep you from something.

It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.

Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!

Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.

Annette! Annette!

Yes, you already did.

I did?

Oh... no thank you...

You're a lucky guy.

What are you talking about?

Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?

Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.

You bastard!

I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.

It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.

Yes, darling.

Oh, lots of times.

I got my wish anyway.

I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today  let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?

I forgot I had it on.

Amy's been lying again.

Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?

And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.

But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.

It was on account of the birthday party.

But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.

But there's no one here, darling.

I don't know yet.

I'm your friend.

That one's an elm.

Oh, thank you, Amy.

Will you come soon?

But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?

The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.

My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.

Yes...yes, that's true.

Come away, Amy.



Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.

That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.

Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.

That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.

Jennifer gave her a make-over.

Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?

Yeah but they looked cool...

I've been working out.

Never felt better.

I mean where on your body?

Good. Except for PMS.

Maybe he's just shy.

Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.

You're just saying that.

Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.

What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?

What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.

What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."

They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.

My vision got worse again.

Rule one: always wear make-up.

Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.

You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...

Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.

No you don't, believe me.

There is a man's arm in my bed.

You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.

I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.

Tuesday. Are you okay?

Did you get rid of Mark?

I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!

Does that mean this whole thing is over?

So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?

So what do I do?

No. I won't let you do that.

Did I kill a guy named Benito?

Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.

So you're Grant's secretary?

I'm not really hungry after all.

I didn't have to pee then.

That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.

So pee? Here?

Oh my god, I'm sorry!

You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!

So pay them back and apologize.

So what book did you buy?

I can forgive you a bestseller.

Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.

No. Nope, nothing in it.

Interesting possibility.

No, my bite's a lot worse.

They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.

Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.

Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?

I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!

I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.

Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?

Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.

She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.

Looks like you need a haircut to me.

Only two bucks.  Shave as well...

Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?

He's seriously disturbed...

You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.

I'm afraid so.

A hunch.  He might be able to...

Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?

<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!

Iím sorry...

I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.

Why are they after you?

Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.

This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?

What is that door?

Wait, this isn't fair...

Shut up!

You know something about me?

Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.

That's what people keep telling me.

We are...  living in their dreams...

Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?

What?

A month.

It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...

Great.

Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,

She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.

Like how?

Exactly. A condition.

No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.

Clean.

And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.

He's only doing what you told him to.

He was only doing his job.

Sort of... Yeah.

... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...

Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...

Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...

I'm not sure... I might have.

It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.

Fine.

We vetoed that?

Wrong...

Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.

She knows.

Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?

What do you mean?

Dirty business we're in sometimes.

Yeah... Sometimes they do.

Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.

We'd like to hire you.

Yeah.

Of course.

First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'

That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?

No thanks.  It's not that far.

I'm outta here.

Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.

I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.

I don't mind.

Oh... Okay.

What?

Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.

Hi.

Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...

Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.

Come on.

I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.

I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...

It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...

I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.

What is it if it ain't a curse?

You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?

Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.

We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.

Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.

They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.

Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.

Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...

Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.

Sir!

Actually I don't really know Mutt.

Will do.

Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?

Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.

Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!

So you really think she means you're going with her?

How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.

Garden?

It's Nuwanda, Cameron.

I couldn't stop myself.

I'm sorry.  I, we

I told you, that's a secret.

What?

I'm not?

But...

"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."

Yes... sir.

Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar

Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!

It's Nuwanda.

Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.

The pleasure is mine.

Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?

Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.

I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.

Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?

Then come with me.

Dead Poets honor.

It's just for a little while. You promised.

Carpe Diem... seize the day.

YAWP!

AHHHHHH!

A madman.

Don't stop!

Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.

You have another choice.

Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.

Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.

I'm calling her!

Then you can help him.

I'm sorry, Neil.

Yes sir.  I'm sorry.

Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-

Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.

But different.

Todd Anderson.

Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.

I'll take him over mine.

As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.

That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.

I guess.

From my father and Nolan.

Oh. 

This play?

Yea, art thou there?

YEA, ART THOU THERE?!

Do you have to quit the play?

Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?

And where is our point of arrival?

I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.

How soon can we get up and running?

Then you better start swimming.

That's where my boat's moored.

I saved your life is what I did!

Anti social?

Right... You have a boat.

Oh yeah? What kind is that?

How do you know that?

The quiet...

A meat locker.

Keep tasting...

Forget them...

I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...

Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...

What? You don't think I can have a normal life?

Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?

A little to the left...

Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...

You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?

A passenger...

Like Mamooli's country...

Hey! You hear me? Come out!

'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...

She fucked me.

Good... Pass the beer.

Get the boots.

Hey Geraldine, let's eat!

I'll get it! Where is it?

So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!

Yeah.

Vince thinks... you know...

It won't open.

Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.

Couple of weeks... Listen --

Yeah.

Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.

Everybody love Linda.

I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!

I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?

No.

Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.

Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!

Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.

Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.

Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.

That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.

Nick.

Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?

Yeah.

Huh?

Yeah.

What else?

Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?

Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?

How much? How much do you wanna bet?

Right.

Same. Hey. Same old stuff.

Here. Behind you.

One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.

You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!

What'cha got, Bennett?

Technothugs?

Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.

What did you say?

Fuck you - fuck you.

Well, you've just been taken off the bench.

Later.  I want Doucet first.

We have to talk.

You're crazy.

What the hell are you talking about?

You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.

It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.

Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.

I got it.  I got it.

Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.

Go in the house.

Technothugs.

Pass.

Trust me.  You don't want to know.

You can't catch this man with a computer.

Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?

Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.

Good night.

Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.

With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.

No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.

Aaah... Mother of Jesus.

He's got my grandson, Sanchez.

Yeah.

I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.

No -- that's for me to do.

The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?

Jabez! Careful --

They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --

They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.

I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --

He lied to me again.

That's my problem, Belle.

Young man -- you got me there.

No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.

Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.

Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.

That's just too bad --

Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...

I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.

Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.

No. She's gone.

But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.

Well, Stone -- have you got the money?

Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.

You are afraid!

A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?

Look here now--

You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --

He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.

Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --

No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.

Never!

Ten throws it is.

I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --

Morning, Jabez.

Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.

That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.

Do you think I'm grudging it?

Jabez ...

There is nothing to worry about now.

But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --

No, no. I don't want to be idle.

Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.

Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.

Isn't that your own fault?

Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!

It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.

All right, Jabez ...

Mary!

That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?

And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.

I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.

And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!

Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?

Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.

The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.

Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.

Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.

I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!

Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.

You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.

Pretty good -- that's perfect!

Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.

H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.

Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.

Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!

Why don't you?

Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.

Married.

You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?

It's okay, it's okay.

Mind if I play some tunes?

It's corny, but I could live with it.

I'll find someplace.

Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.

We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!

How about his job?

Tell me about it.

What does he want?

See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?

And if he alters it...?						*

Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!

He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!

If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!

It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!

Who are you, then?

Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.

We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.

I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other.

Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?

Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...

Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?

I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.

Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.

I'm ahead of you...partner.

Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?

Two?  Are you sure?

Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?

In my youth, partner.  In my youth.

Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.

I...I shot a kid.

I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.

Bullshit.

How do you know?

What's it look like?  We're going in.

Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!

This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?

Heidi, I'm dying.

It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...

That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.

Yeah.  It was terrible.

What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?

Well...

You're crazy.

Why you going to Algeria?

God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.

I don't know... you could have picked a better place.

What?

All right.  Then what do you want me to say?

That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?

Look... who's on the phone?

All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?

Do you still want the operation?

I'm not alone.

Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?

What do you want to know that for?

Call me Sonny-boy.

One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.

Call me whatever you want.

Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.

... armed robbery ...

When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!

It's okay, you got a lot of protection.

I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.

What do you want?

No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.

I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...

Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.

It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...

I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...

There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?

Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!

We're bringing in your wife...

He's all doped up.

He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.

It's all we got.

Gimme the keys to get outta here!

It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.

Mulvaney...

I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.

What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?

You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...

I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.

You seem like a likable enough guy. It's hard to judge.

Howard!

I told you, he's got diabetes.

Yeah.

Pure?

Yeah - it's all right... let's go.

How'd that happen?

Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?

... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!

Wyoming.

It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...

Okay.

I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.

You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?

What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'

He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.

Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.

What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.

If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.

No!

I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?

Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?

Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...

I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.

Come over around seven.

Yeah, but I'm buying.

That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.

Famous? I've never heard of it.

Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...

Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.

Cool.

You're it.

No.

Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.

Oh, is this your special place?

The second R is silent.

Now that's more of what we're looking for.

Who's Captain Rob?

Exactly! A pirate!

You're not my real dad.

When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?

HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!

I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.

I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.

Shut up!

Just wanted to see how your doing.

I bet you want your head scratched.

So, have you given him "some" yet? 

Go away, assface.

You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.

Yeah, that's why I asked.

Am not.

That must be her boyfriend's car.

He must be on his way to pee out a fire.

Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.

I lugged it all over town!

She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.

Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.

He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.

No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.

Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.

Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?

I don't know what you're talking about.

TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.

I'll talk to you later.

If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.

Don't answer me. Say what I say.

Do you want me to pet your head?

I know, you want go for a ride.

Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.

Tomorrow night?

Let's just do it and get out of here.

Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?

That's the downside. There is none.

Go in there and get us two slushees.

He passed away three years ago.

You know I do!

It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...

Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!

People! Come on. "Parade" float.

Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.

Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.

But we don't drink from the house do we.

Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.

Yes!

Who's there?

What?

Well I've got a little surprise for you.

No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.

Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.

I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.

JESSICA. Are you sure?

Love it!

Piter.

What does Leto say, Piter?

I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.

Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.

So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...

Basically...

It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.

That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.

Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.

I'm sorry Gurney.

Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.

Paul!!  Paul!!

I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.

They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.

I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?

Always.

Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...

The most lethal poison in the Universe.

I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.

Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.

I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?

Not all of them... I know which ones will.

No.

I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.

Don't you bave a car?

No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.

I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.

Hey Bela, how do you do that?

Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!

Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?

Ah!  This is very exciting.

Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.

Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.

Don't let me slow you down.

I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.

No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.

Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.

I dunno.  Lie on the beach?

And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --

You mean a Tesla coil?

Rolling.

These shoes are itchy.

Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."

It's that easy?

Isn't he?

You got the job?!!

Better than not getting a job?

So did you get his autograph?

I don't know.  It's so much money...

That's ridiculous.

I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."

I told you this was gonna happen.

Does she have room for me?

I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?

Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.

I understand you just moved here?

Well, uh, if I could I would...

Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.

Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.

You could say that --

No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.

I like.  When do movie shoot?

But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.

We're escaping!

There's still a sex-change --

So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.

Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.

Um, I guess --

Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.

STOP!

Uh, atomic energy?

Dynamite --

Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.

So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.

No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?

YES!  JUST DO IT!

Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!

I'm directing.

And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!

No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.

You know, you're a very attractive girl.

Isn't that the same thing?

Do they show it?

No! Do they show you having sex?

At what point?

Anything good?

Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.

Went --

What?

Cool.

And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.

Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?

Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.

Good luck.

Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?

No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.

Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...

Right, right...

Oh.

Do you want us to come in the kitchen?

He says --

He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.

Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.

What's the matter?!

But Al is your husband now!

I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?

Never would be plenty.

Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?

Welcome to work, Ed.

Okay ...

Yeah.

Well, when you put it that way.

Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?

Yeah, well...

You should see the one we wear when it rains.

Why?

I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.

I know, I ...

Shari...

Somewhere.

No. It's your fault.

Where were you?

What?

Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.

Screw off.

Oh, Jesus.

What's the dif --

She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --

Please!

Ray, come an--

Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?

Oh, man! So...

Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.

We have to stop meeting like this.

Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.

pierdo.

pierdes.

Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.

Thank you.

Yeah, uh, just a minute

Yeah, just --

But, Mr. M. -

Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy

Good luck, Tracy.

So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.

Why are you lecturing me?

Looks like today's your lucky day

You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.

That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?

I'm looking at new cars.

Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.

Uh-huh.

Yes?

Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.

Would you sign it for me?

Take as much room as you want

Just wait outside. Tammy.

I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.

I have proof.

Sure.

Should we get a what?

Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.

Three twenty-five.

It's the only true thing I know anymore.

I'm not like you.

I know.

You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.

Sure, Tracy.

Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*

Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.

Okay.  Great.  I feel good.

Till 19-fucking-70.

It's practically stamped on your forehead.

Are you sorry she's dead?

You fuck for money.

If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --

No.  Now.  You fucked him.

This business, Captain?

Call me Dudley.

I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?

You've got it, Wendell.

What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?

What are you talking about?

Let my daughter rest in peace.

It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?

Which one are you and which one am I?

He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.

What about him?

I'm not asking you.

I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?

Against your code?

What little studio?

And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?

I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.

Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.

It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.

It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...

Until he gunned down six people.

Dogs got no reason to live.

Man, what're you saying?

Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.

And?

In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --

Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.

Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?

Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.

It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.

We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.

Anonymous.  Probably nothing.

Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.

No.

Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?

A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.

Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.

I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.

Bud White's been here?

I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.

He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.

You want to know what Bud's like in bed?

I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.

Some reality.

Why not?

You, me and White, huh?

I know how he feels.

What's Dudley's scheme?

Officer White?

You lost me, Sid.  Who?

Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.

Sid, how are they hanging?

What's he doing here, Sid?

Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.

You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.

Yeah.

Something like that.

Showbiz.

Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?

It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.

Yes.

Nothing.

Nothing.

Rachel Banks?

Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.

And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--

We said a hundred.

I called from a payphone!

How'd you have the manpower to--

Why'd you leave?

Those are Feds.

Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?

Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.

We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--

So what do we do now?

Not particularly, no.

The thing is...it really can't wait.

A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.

Oh my God.

Can you help me?

Hey, did you guys find my stuff?

I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.

I'm not his attorney.

Because I don't know.

No, sir.

No.

Yes sir.

This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.

Just for the criminals.

I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.

I saw a man die.

The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.

Yeah.

A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.

Robert--

I see her for business.

I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.

Was that doctored-up, too?

I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--

Yes.

This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.

What is it?

It's over.

A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.

Don't count on it.

I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--

You didn't squeeze DePinto?

I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.

You're not.

Eat your fish.

Why?

Who's doing this?

I'm sorry about that.

It's not me?

--otherwise we may have to--

Seat 74.

Merry Christmas, son.

Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.

Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.

Where's Stacy?

Dad!

Where's mom?

Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.

Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?

You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?

Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?

Calm down.

Bobby--

Why would they--

You're tired.

You gotta let me bring you in to the police.

Bobby, you're in way over your head.

Yeah.

I need help.

Are you still in Crystal City?

You remember Daniel Zavitz?

I honestly don't know.

Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.

You would?

What the hell does it mean?

He had help.

You're kidding me.

Dean's with Lyle.

So they know everything.

Oh, let's assume that they have.

What about the tape?

For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.

You have any idea what kind of position this--

I'm sorry - what have you noticed?

Excuse me?

I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?

Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.

Now.

What?  No!

I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.

Would you let me pass?

No.

I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.

I promise I'll come back.  I promise I'll never leave you.  And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.

Appropriate?

I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.

Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!

Could I trouble you for some water?

No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.

Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.

Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.

Her hands and feet were tied.

What's the matter with you?

Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.

Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.

You were in Africa?

So was my Patient.

So you can shoot a pistol?

If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.

I don't know what that means.

She can take you as far as Florence.

I've had a drink.  Fatal.

Very true!

I see.

Thousands of people did die, just different people.

Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't I couldn't even do that properly.

You can't kill me.  I died years ago.

Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft

Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.

What?

Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.

No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.

Your friend?

Why?  Is he staying?

I've been told that before.

Hey! -

Is something funny?

Thank you.

Nya-nya-nya!

Kip I -

He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?

Hello miss.

I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.

A toddler

Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.

Why not?

Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.

I don't think so.

I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.

What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.

Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.

Why?  Are you German?

Through a window.

Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.

Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.

And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.

I don't know, but close.

Who am I?

Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...

Uh, yes.

You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.

You...you can't.

Not a word.

What's your problem? I'm doing the job.

I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.

It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.

In a week.

We're doing this together. We're partners.

You don't get the Mask code unless I go.

I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.

Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.

When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.

These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.

Got it.

What?

Okay, 80-20--

Hold the record. Alone.

You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.

My job, my rules.

And the money goes--

Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.

We're doing it tonight.

Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.

Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.

Surgically attached.

Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.

Oh, I don't care about the money.

China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...

You can do it.

No, you can't.

I'm not leaving without you.

But--

What about you?

You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.

Next time I'll use valet parking.

Had to get a liquid plasma screen.

Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.

It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.

Because I never assume anything.

This better be worth 1t.

You damn well thought wrong.

It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.

Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.

We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...

Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.

Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.

Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?

Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.

What's your point?

Yes?

Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.

Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?

Wow.  Why would they do that?

I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.

Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?

A number for the whole group, or for us?

... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?

If you hadn't used profanity --

I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.

I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.

I guess I'm not the right kind.

Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.

Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.

Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.

What, you think I'm made of money?

Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?

And I realized, he's taking a chance too.

-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.

Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?

Kinda like David and what's-his-name?

She lived on the plume.  You never know.

They skipped that step.

Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.

Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.

I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?

I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.

Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.

Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.

No one's taking anything --

Uh-huh.

With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.

Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --

Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.

Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.

Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...

Did he say why?

Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?

And ...?

Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.

I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?

Nope.  Maiden.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.

Have you been to the water board?

Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...

Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.

Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.

I do.

Ten?

C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.

You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.

Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?

Better safe than sorry.

What do you mean?

One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.

Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.

Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?

I need it.

I will.  Bye.

Yes?

Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.

Yes, Admiral .... soon.

This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!

He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.

And that is why I must go.

What's wrong with him?

What happened?

Howls.

Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.

Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!

Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?

Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.

Then I'll see you in Hell.

You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.

Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.

I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...

Sit down, and shut up!

Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?

I'm going to see what it is.

Yes.

We are fighting for a cause much ...

Or you ran into something ....

Now you're making sense.

What is it?

Try and control this ...

You're going to attack them?!!!

Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.

A mining colony.

It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.

Who's staring?

You look great.

Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?

You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.

I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.

Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.

I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.

I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.

Thanks.

We have no use for your kind.

Luke needs help.  We must go back.

Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.

Let's go.

I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...

He'll survive.

Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.

Only what you take with you.

I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.

No!

Time will tell.

Anything on the Millennium Falcon?

But we saw Earth destroyed.

Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.

There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.

He's a gorilla.

I'm a psychiatrist.

I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.

Please

Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.

It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.

Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.

C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.

You never heard of Snake Plissken?

Don't lie to me.

You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?

I don't know yet.

My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?

What's the little black box do?

So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?

I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.

Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.

Let's just say it's what's best for the country.

I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.

You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.

Delgado?

Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.

I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.

I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.

We'll see.

Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.

Which way?

Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?

The what?

How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.

I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.

Give me the prototype.

I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?

I will not.

I sought only not to harm you, sir.

I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.

Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.

Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!

'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.

Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?

...to ride out and meet them.

Never where you expect it, that's all I know.

What is it my child?

I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?

That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...

My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.

So be it.

I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.

Ye...

--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?

Yes. I would swear my love to you.

Love demands it.

Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?

Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.

The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...

Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...

I am the desert, where water disappears--

Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.

Fuck it.

And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?

In here!

No kidding.

We have to start looking for a shrink.

Yes, I'm affraid it is.

Uh huh. 'Fraid so.

All right then we've got clean rats.

I just heard them Karl.

What!

Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!

Never.

Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!

The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.

No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?

That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.

It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.

Yes am.

Sure did.

The priest.

If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.

No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.

Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.

But how?

Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!

You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!

What?

Father?

No.

Here I'll show you.

You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.

I wouldn't talk.

How do you know?

My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.

Damien Karras.

Okay.

College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.

There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.

I came to say goodbye.

How's the girl?

Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.

What an excellent day for an exorcism.

Intensely.

In time.

In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?

Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.

Uoy era ohw.

How's your leg?

No.

Why?

But deliver us from the evil one.

The Lord be with you.

Her heart.

What's this about?

From the psychiatric end.

You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?

I don't know anyone who fits the description.

No I probably wouldn't.

Very much.

Who's in it?

I've seen it.

Be silent!

Bastards! Stop!

Yes?

Are you a relative?

So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.

It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.

We have some lotion.

The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.

Accident?

I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.

How's the birthday girl?

Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.

Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.

Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.

Frank.

Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.

You look like you just crawled out of bed.

Jack...

Fuck him.

Bosen black.  Flat.

Funny.  Strike a bell?

I don't gotta go.

What do you mean?

Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.

Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.

I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.

It wasn't like that.

Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.

Yeah, and what put him up there?

If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --

What?

Come on, stand still.

It's not gonna hurt you.

She's here.

That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.

Yeah, fine.

Right.

Last?

Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.

No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.

It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.

How come I didn't hear anything?

No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.

A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.

Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?

Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...

Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?

You always threw up.

You could've come.

I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.

I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?

Seventy-one

Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?

I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.

That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.

No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.

This'll kill 'em.

Just call me a cab.

All right.

All right.

Doctor's orders.

It's one of Jack's favorites.

We ran long.

Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.

No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.

Changed?

What's wrong with it?

Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.

Virgins.

Smells like tuna number two to me.

Yeah.

They must've bought the same map we did.

You want to tell me what the hell's going on?

What're you talking about?  They love it.

Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.

Yes, well, they are.

Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.

I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.

You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.

You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.

I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.

His kid's sick.

Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.

Every year.

It's okay.  Last one.

Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.

Guess I got a little scattered.

Better than that.

It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.

Let's make a deal.  You shut up.

Who's Nina?

Soap?

Long story.

Frank wasn't 'there.

Hi.

I didn't want to wake you.

What are they?

Why not?

Okay.  How'd yours go?

Eddie.

Should be.  It's yours.

Shut up.

So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?

You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.

You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?

Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.

It's important.

How come?

Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.

Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.

Would it?

The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.

You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.

Not anymore.

Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.

Walton, you have to let me see the warden --

You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!

Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?

What happened?

Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?

What?

You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?

There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.

Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.

What do you know about it?

They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?

Call me spontaneous.

I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.

That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.

Good.  Because I'm fed up.

Back then -- who wasn't?

You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.

Excuse me?

I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?

Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...

Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.

Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...

Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?

Im sure you do...

What about me?

Seven.  Really.

Who did?

Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?

I think I could figure it out.

Sure.

Five thirty.  Okay.

Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.

I dont think so.

Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!

Hey, Im doing the best I can...  Id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...

Its your birthday? Today?  Whats your name?  Where were you born?

There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.

Hey...

Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?

Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...

I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!

Look, I just want my life back.  Now whats it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Lets talk turkey!  How much money...?

Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.

You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...

Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?

Uh huh...

You hear me complaining about that?

Yeah...fine.

Pro bono.  You dont get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...

No, shes not.

And...?

Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.

Its an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  Im gonna buy it...

If you want to look at it that way...

Sorry, Jack.  Its too important to me.

What...?

No, open it...

Enjoy it, sweetheart...

Thats a big one for me, too.

I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...

Think bigger.

A perk for what?

What are you talking about, Jack?

Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...

Look, youre making this into something its not. This isnt a referendum on our lives, Kate. Its a step forward...  Dont you see?  Im talking about us finally having a life other people envy.

But Ive done some good things too, havent I?

Promise me again...

Not with what they pay me...

We have two kids, Annie and Josh...

You suddenly having trouble getting dates?

Youre a little tougher, Peter.

Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!

Hey, are you okay?

Is there anything I can do for you?

So we'll get egg nog.

Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?

Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?

Trust me, this ain't one of those times.

Relax, it's casual.

This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.

He's made a few changes.

<u>Should</u>?

Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.

Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.

If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.

Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --

This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.

Put your tiny little mind at ease.

I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --

To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.

Is it safe?

Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?

Victor must've taken him.

What do you mean "complete"?

The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --

What about you?

Ben!  Ben!

The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.

They're not costumes.

But all these people...

Johnny.

Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.

No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.

History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?

Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --

<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."

You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...

Hilarious.

Sure.

Ben did this.

He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.

I was talking about us.  Working together.

It's been changed.

Passion.

Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.

We need to get past them.

I'm sure I can come up with something.

Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.

You <u>were</u>?

I'm sure I can come up with something.

Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...

Victor, are you feeling alright?

Just <u>find</u> him.

I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.

Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.

We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?

Medical's ready.

Phase Two.

In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.

Message to Proteus.

It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.

I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.

What can I do? Except maybe pass out?

And take a little trip with them...

Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.

Yes?

No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.

Yes, Cora.

They're much smaller than bacteria...

No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.

You may learn to like it.

Now I know...

Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --

Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --

No, it requires such absolute precision --

That's what they pay me for.

As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?

You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --

All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!

Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.

You mean Inner Space is endless?

Quite a piece of plumbing.

Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?

If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...

Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.

If there's any chance --

If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?

Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.

I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?

I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.

No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.

Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.

Sorry, but the situation has changed.

Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.

It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.

Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.

Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.

Enough to breathe, but that's all.

Uh -- what?

We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.

What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --

What do you mean?

I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.

I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!

Where's my daughter?

Certainly.

What's this, sir?

What?

HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!

The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.

Yeah, you already said that.

I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -

Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.

What the heck d'ya mean?

Yah, but that TruCoat -

Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -

One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!

Oh, he's adorable.

Where'd you get him that parka?

Oh, no, I can't let you do that.

Officer Olson.

Uh-huh.

Ya got that right.

White Bear Lake?

Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.

Chaska.

In what way?

Can you be any more specific?

Was he funny-looking apart from that?

So you were having sex with the little fella, then?

Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.

Yah, that can happen.

Uhn.

Yeah!

Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.

...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?

No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.

Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?

What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?

No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!

My father-in-law, he's the owner.

I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.

Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.

Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

Know who this is?

Jerome Lundegaard?

Good day, sir.

We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.

Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.

You told me about it.

Jean and Scotty never have to worry.

We might be innarested.

2:30.

Yah.

No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -

Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.

No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -

No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!

No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!

Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.

Mm.

Put you in touch with Grimsrud.

I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?

Call 'em up.

Yah.

Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.

Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.

Yah...

Yah.

Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.

Aw, you can sleep, hon.

Just a Diet Coke.

Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!

No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.

No, no, that's fine.

Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?

Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.

Nope.

His wife?

No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.

The day of our homicides.

Yah.

Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.

My car! My car! Tan Ciera!

Yah?

Thanks, hon.

Uh-huh.

No, no.

Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.

When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!

His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.

He's at Norstar.

Oh.

Bob, Bob... I'm a member.

You need to make these your primary "action items."

Have you finished those reports?

Some of it, yes.

"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?

You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.

This is... really a shock...

You want to see pain?  Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the guys with testicular cancer.  That's pain.

It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.

You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.

I don't know -- am I?

Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.

You haven't been going to yours.

I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?

Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.

Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.

Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?

Feel anything?

Well... thanks, anyway.

Whatever.

Do you care?

It was the smart move on her part.

What do you get out of it?

... A person.

What is wrong with you?

What... ?

You fucking slut!!

... You know me?

Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.

Okay, everyone.

That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.

How's that working out for you?

And, now it's gone.

There's always that.

The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.

This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.

The things you own, they end up owning you.

No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.

You get the idea.

This is crazy.

Like hell.  That counted.

My dad.  No question.

Doesn't matter.

Good answer.

He was obviously able to handle it.

No.  Not at all.

"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."

A liposuction clinic.

Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.

No, I'm not...

I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.

Hey.

I felt like destroying something beautiful.

No.

You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.

If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?

Wait a minute...

Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?

And, sometimes you control it...

You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...

You... you can't be serious about this.

I'm not going...

I quit.

Defuse the bomb, please.

Why what?

Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.

I swear on my life, I won't...

What have you left for me?

Not my mouth.  Our mouth.

You told me you'd say that.

Too much school.

Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.

Should we knock?

We need to hurry.

If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...

Carter.

Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.

Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.

Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.

No.  What's this about?

Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...

Like what?

...My Premonition was just like his.

Clean up?  I don't...

Who is this guy, anyway?

How do you know?

He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!

Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.

No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.

I know how it feels to be dead.

I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.

Hey, Dad.  What's up?

I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.

I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.

It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.

What if Tod... is just the first... of us?

I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?

Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?

Like... 4:25.

I wish you were on the plane!

I don't.

That's a plan.

Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?

"Next?"

No harm. No foul.

Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...

Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...

Start over.

Ninety.

Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.

This is state-of-the-art firepower.

No.

American?

You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.

I thought he was with you.

Where's his father?

Huntington Beach, California.

How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.

How?

We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.

About 22 hours on site.

You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.

Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.

It's not over.  You made one mistake.

De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.

There were treating me like a headcase.

That's it.  My life.

I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.

I say we tape him to a chair.

Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.

But now it's free, right?

It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".

Meeting ... people.

Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!

Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.

I smell gas... Do you smell gas...

I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --

I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.

Well, what the hell does that mean?

He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!

"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?

No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?

Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!

You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.

I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...

Uh... basement I think...

Tragedy?

Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.

I... I was just leaving.

Yes... I... I agree...

You can ask.

Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.

I was nine in the sixties.

Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.

Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...

Tonight!  How's tonight?

What girl?  I didn't notice.

My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?

They're --  -- What?

<u>What</u>!?

Sshhhh!

I'm the one what?

Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.

I don't know.

Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...

So what? You going to help me?

The Red Knight!

Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.

Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...

What are the other reasons?

No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.

Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?

BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!

<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>

You won't be alone for long.

We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.

No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.

You don't have to say that.

Oh... You mean you don't want to.

Shhh...

I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!

No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...

Will you just do what the hell I tell you...

I'm not.

Yes.

I love it.

No.

Who said I was depressed?

I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.

No.

Palm Apodaca.

Who?

What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?

I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.

Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.

That's good.

This is a very special, very old CB 275...

You know who it once belonged to?

Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...

I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?

You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...

You know, he was formerly a sailor.

My turn.

Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.

Yeah, I'll probably be free.

I gave it a second thought.

Thank you.

None.

No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.

It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.

Shut up...

Is he?

What?

I'll be back later...

Oh. You have to tell me that.

Just give me a chance, will you?

No, the last time was three years ago.

What?

Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.

At game, Carl.

Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.

No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...

No, it's okay.

Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.

It is true.

I hope I didn't hear that.

I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.

What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?

What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.

Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...

In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...

And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...

Steam.

There's some good things on it, though.

Well, she was.

Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.

Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.

Is it true?

Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.

I, umm, came to see you.

You got a boyfriend?

I buy them flowers.

She fucks it all up!

Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-

You gonna talk to him?

A girl named Amanda.

I'm a good friend of hers.

Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.

Jus' from around the way.

Yeah.

Unbelievable.

Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.

Whaddyamean 'maybe'?

Sonofabitch.

I have no idea.

He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?

Nineteen.

I busted their window, they didn't do anything.

Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.

Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.

Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?

Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.

We play tennis at the club.

Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.

Joan or Margaret Smith.

Well, which one?

Funny old bird.

Fletch...

You don't know me.

Yes, right away.

That's it?

My lawyer was a bum.

Yes. Where you from, Harry?

Right.

No problem.

Fletch, I never sold nothing.

I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.

Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?

Come inside.

In this drawer....

Precisely. Are you a good shot?

Take it where?

They serve dinner on the flight?

You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?

Not me.

No problem, boss.

Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.

Not our kind of people, you understand.

You've met her?

Cute thing.

I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.

It's Scotch-Rumanian.

I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.

None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.

Hi.

It's amazing.

Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.

I think you should call me Gail, now.

Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.

I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.

Bastard.

I'm calling the police. Right now.

They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.

Lock's busted.

Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.

I'm her cousin.

Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!

I don't know.  Look!

He's not the story! There's a source behind him.

But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.

Not really?

My secretary.

Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.

I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.

Of course.

In a minute!

Who's your decorator?

Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?

But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...

Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.

Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.

Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...

I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...

Exactly.

Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.

Contacts.

Yeah, let's bury her.

Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.

Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!

Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.

Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.

What?

I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...

It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!

No.  Who's Art Mooney?

But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.

No, wait...

As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'

I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?

Did he just say what I think he said?

You need it.

Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...

Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...

Really?

Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.

The case!

Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.

Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.

Ciao.

You're a poet and didn't know it.

Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.

Mr. Doyle.

I'm clean.

Boca?

Doesn't register.

Where do you want it?

Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?

Are you having trouble raising the half million?

Encore du sho ping!

Non!

Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.

I'm going to put them on the cat.

Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.

But will they?

S'right.

What?

Perhaps he's visiting a guest.

Names.

What's he do?

Yeah, I know.

I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.

Who's on him?

Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.

Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.

We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.

Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.

Pour it in your ear.

This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.

Whatta you got?

Darling, may I have this one?

What is that old building?

I been damn careful up to now.

You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?

So what?

Yeah.

That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.

Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.

Baltimore?

Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.

I'm alright, Gibby.

The usual.

He ain't the only one.

I know.  He loves that thing.

The future guy?

I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!

Frank...

Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.

Uh, huh.

How's that?

Frank, please...

Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?

Daddy, I'm scared.

Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.

No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.

This afternoon?

What'd you just say?

Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.

Johnny...?

It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.

I don't understand.

Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.

He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.

I don't know...  What about the other women?

They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.

It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.

No.

But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?

In my pocket.

Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.

I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.

Huh?

Gordo?

Sounds good.

So how are things at the hospital?

No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.

No.  What house you work?

I hear that.

No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.

You have the right to speak to an att --

I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.

Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?

Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!

I don't know...

Barely.

I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.

Did you stay here last night?

Somebody was in here.

I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?

Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.

The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.

... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.

I'm trying.  I'm really trying.

It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.

May be please have the wallet.

Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.

Maybe.

I have to.

Who's Horace?

Why?

Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.

You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.

I could swear I heard...

This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...

It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.

Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.

You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.

All he's asking is for you to check it out.

Daddy, what is going on?

Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...

'Cause it stinks.

It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.

Did you hear me?!

No, he was real.  Like on TV.

No more.

All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.

Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.

Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.

Will you listen, dammit!

I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.

If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.

Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --

Skin stretcher was human.

I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.

Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?

Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?

I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!

That's what I'd like to know.

Sorry.

Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.

Her name's Stephanie.

Oh my God, Steven.

Yeah...

You don't know shit!

About what?

She did!

Really?

Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...

What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.

You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?

Hear what?

It's...dead.

Oh dear God...

She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?

What are you talking about?

I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.

You're telling a lie.

She didn't push me into coming.

Just felt a little chill.

There's something I haven't told you...

About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.

The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.

Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.

Very bad today.

What do you mean, we must abandon?

That's where I peed.

Do not inhale.

I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.

Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.

Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.

Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.

Do we care?

Where is it?

That was a big mistake.

The American theater doesn't need people like that.

Keep going west. Last building before the river.

Paisley Porter.

About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.

This could be it.

This could be it.

This could be it.

Our Peter?

About what?

This is how we've managed to last.

In and out of bed.

I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.

Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?

Take it yourself. Take a date.

First you tell me.

Packs an emotional wallop.

A flat-out hit.

Yes.

Two-all after six.

We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.

Who the hell cares?

I'd forgotten that.

I'm glad we're having this talk.

Life is good.

I don't know if I can say that.

What did it say?

I'm at the door.

You know the answer to that.

It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.

My back is killing me.

I lost it. I lose everything.

Everybody else does. Why not you?

Oh yeah?

He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.

This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.

Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?

I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.

Washed away.

This could be it!

Why does it matter?

Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.

hat was this morning.

You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.

Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.

I was educated by nuns.

I have excellent long-term memory.

I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.

I kissed her while she was laughing.

I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.

Not one of Steven's finer moments.

Engaging.

Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.

The fact is, I have to get going.

Someone waiting for you?

Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.

And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.

I'm going home to my machine.

As I told you about English policemen.

Eleven.

Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.

Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.

I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.

Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.

He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.

I hope not.

Hm.  Is it?

It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.

An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.

Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.

There is nothing I can give.

No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.

My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.

I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.

Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.

I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.

He's "discovering" India.

I like football.

It would be five thousand more.

I guess I'm a slow learner.

Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.

No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.

I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!

Luca could still be an accomplice.

Again?

What's wrong with him?

Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?

Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.

Keep going!!  Keep going!!

How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.

Good choice.

If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?

Michael's.

Not bad, Jerome.

In case you get back before I do.

I'm travelling too.

They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".

How tall are you?

No.

Why would we do that?

Friend?

Yes...<i>yes</i>...

You'll be next.

What exactly is wrong?

Of course.

I guess somebody beat me to it.

Those checks take forever.

Let's walk.

I'll tell you at the end of the week.

This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...

I heard about you. You work with Miller.

They may nail me into this now, McCoy.

I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.

No way. I've got to get out now.

I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.

Yeah.

What do you mean? You've never been there.

That Beynon's got a long arm.

Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.

Fatter... some things never change.

No. It's been a long time.

It's all right.

Better than I remembered.

You were asleep.

Suit yourself.

But sometimes I cried a lot too.

Want to cry now?

Usually on the right side as you go in.

At least you were outside.

We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.

There wasn't any way to explain it.

I mean it.

I think you liked it with him.

Let's do it.

Twenty eight hundred.

No scars.

We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.

You want to try with me?

I'll be ready.

Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.

Where do we go from here?

Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.

We walk.

No, I'm afraid not.

I really hope you have a nice trip.

Might try that.

What about you?

Wire pull over?

Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.

I kinda doubt it.

Not now.

Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.

Just... tell us what you want.

Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.

Who?

He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.

I know.

Jack...

I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.

Doreen.

I can't.

Nicer than most.

He was gentlemanly. I like that.

While he was here. You went about together?

Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.

We're there now.

Entertaining.

They said he was drunk.

I left last year.

Working at Woolworths.

Thanks.

Did you work with him, Keith?

That's what I was wondering.

Today? At the races. He always goes.

Where you off to?

Yeah.

No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.

I see.

Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?

Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.

You sure?

My brother, Frank.

I'm sorry.

Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.

Ta-ra.

What's that supposed to mean?

No.

A bereavement. A death in the family.

Making a living.

You should have told me who you were working for.

Not till I'm dead, Eric.

Knock it off, Gerald.

...Polacks...

I had to.

Mmm...

You get a bad month, all of a...

I heard that they were running cold.

The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.

What hard part?

What?

You...

That's what I...

What?

What do you mean?

Yes...?

What?

Did you talk to Graff?

What if you don't get caught?

Yes.  I'm sure.

...and rob the place...

Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.

That's right.

That's none of your fucking business...

Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?

I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.

What?  You can't do any what?

Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.

That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.

You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.

Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.

Yes.  The cops.  No.

No, who?

Why?

Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 

Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.

Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.

That they're going to be upset.

Just go to lunch.

Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...

Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 

Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?

...did they...

Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.

Levene!

Levene!!

I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.

Could I...

Get in the goddamn room.

Shelly, you blew the last...

Let me...

Murray said...

Yes.

...apart from the top men on the contest board.

Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.

I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...

I have to go... 

I can't split them.

The leads are coming.

All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.

It's not impossible.

Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?

Who kept the other half?

No, I don't think so, Shel.

What sales?

I'm sorry.

My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...

"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."

Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...

...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...

Guess who?

...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.

Well, we'll do that this weekend.

Kenilworth.

Did I...?

Mmmm...

Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...

I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...

But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...

Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

Tell me again.  Your wife.

She told me I have to.

She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...

You going to turn State's?

Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.

You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?

Who said "Fuck the Machine"?

I'm going home.

The...

...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...

John...

Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.

Yes.

I got lots of presents.

No, where is it?

I can't.

To do business.

I'm not hungry.

We have no money for a rug.

Oh yes, the very best.

 He's going to kill Fanucci.

This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.

I saw him with you.

Michael...

Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.

I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?

 You must understand, this is all new to me...

But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.

Let's go.

Forget it, just go take care of her.

I want you to help me, Fredo.

Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.

You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.

...Who?

But, you told me yourself...

Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?

What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?

He's an Italian?

Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?

What?

No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?

In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.

 And he agreed?

I'm supposed to stay in my house.

I'm going to see my parents.

Kay... Kay...

We don't know that's true, he never said that.

She's gone, Tom.

I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.

Yes.

I can't let him down.

Yeah, give me a minute.

But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...

Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?

My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.

His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;

Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?

The room has a bug in it.

Tom, what do I do now?

Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.

Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.

Very well.

He is, I believe, a brother.

The committee is adjourned until further notice.

If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.

I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?

It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!

Who's asking?

Yes.

You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.

The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.

I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.

The money was sent.

I know that; but who gave the go ahead.

Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?

When do we talk?

You were unfair with them.

Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.

Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?

I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.

Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.

Some water.

I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.

All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.

Keep them alive.

And?

Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.

You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.

The same assurance we got from you.

We got no choice.

That's a lucky C note for our new deal.

Not anymore you don't.  Doll.

What's to be jealous of?

Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.

I didn't mean to...

If you enjoy it, you should do it.

Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.

What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?

Expect nothing fancy.

That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?

Of course.  I am married still.

He is dead now, twenty years.

No!

I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.

There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.

I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.

We have his note.

But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?

But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?

In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.

This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.

I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.

What's to sketch?

You don't say?  Which picture?

All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.

No.  I'm fine.

This David's a friend?

Did you now?

Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.

I don't like to talk about that.

Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.

Can't today.

You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.

I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.

What happened?

Do you miss it?

I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --

There's no people like you in my crowd.

No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --

You asked me to model.  Remember?

Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.

Run for what?

Never gave it much thought.

But you said --

The Great War?

I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.

All right.

I think I'll hang around.

Have a drink?

I just want to watch it, okay?

Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.

Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?

Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?

Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.

In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.

More your line.

Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.

Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.

No.  I expect you can't.

Everything.  Start at the beginning.

But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.

Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.

Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.

I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.

Head.  Not heart.

I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.

Sit?

Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.

The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.

And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.

I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...

My version of "take this job and shove it..."

Point-five ...

"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...

This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?

But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --

I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...

You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...

Kip.

Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.

Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...

Castlebeck.

Needs brightening ...

Not at all ...

You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -

Good.

Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...

Donny-nothin'!

Hey, Donny --

That's a good one, Donny...

Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...

No ... And they won't take my calls ...

We don't -- ?

Atley Jackson came to see me ...

I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?

Every day. I wonder about that every day...

It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...

Yeah... You want a ride...

How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?

What am I supposed to do?

You, too

Yeah ...

Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?

About what?

About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...

"Shadow games?"

The family that steals together, deals together...

It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"

I dunno. Whatever will be will be...

What?

Sure, man --

Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like

Thought I'd go for a ride -

For real?

The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...

No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...

A distinction worth noting ...

Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.

I understand -

I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...

A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...

Deodorant.

No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...

Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...

I take out my slim-jim...

They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...

Cut 'em...

No worries ...

And Tracy's on the move ...

Are you considering a comeback tour?

His criminal career has officially come to a close ...

He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.

Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up

Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...

Shit all looks the same here --

The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.

Me? Why would I get into that shit?

Nods.

It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.

You treated me like shit.

Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.

I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?

Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.

How much?

What did he say, exactly?

Paul will calm down. You'll see.

Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.

Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.

What lions? I'm not going near any lions.

Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.

Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?

Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.

How?

Yeah.

What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.

My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.

I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.

They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?

Yeah.

I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.

Tommy  ...

Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.

It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?

Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.

I don't want them left back.

But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.

Suck my cock!

Stop crowdin the plate!

What are we gonna do up there?

Fuck you.

Next week.

No one. I didn't have the number.

Week after I'm twenty-one.

She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...

And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG!

You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.

Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?

Retainer...

History.

That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"

It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.

It's touching me.

Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!

Yeah, can I help you?

Hey fuck you.

Fuck do you want?

Really?

What're those?

Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.

It's an integer proof.

--Half-red, half-black--

An integer.

That's fine, but did you ever think--

I appreciate that.

Find out what?

Uh-oh.

He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...

Five.

Just meet with the boy once a week.

It's on the college.

I been here a couple years.

Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.

I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!

Come in.

Never been.

I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.

You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?

You guys are fuckin' sick.

--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.

Like what, Will?

I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.

You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.

How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"

Nautilus?

285.

Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.

That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?

I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?

Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.

Hence, the word remarried.

Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.

Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.

"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?

You're kiddin' me.

I don't know.

I guess.

What did I think?

What?

Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...

Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?

You're not going to fail me are you?

--No, have you had any experience with that?

Cause fuck him, that's why.

It's not your fault.

It's not your fault.

I'm Will.

I kind of got that impression.

I bet your parents were happy to pay.

Is Harvard gettin' all that money?

Okay...

Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.

Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?

I'm sorry, I been real busy.

Aah, it's kind of a hike.

All right, all right. We'll go.

No.

It's important that I learn this.

I can't go out to California.

What am I scared of?

At least you have a mother.

I'm not honest?

Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.

Let 'er go, Gallagher!

We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.

Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?

You're *ticklin' me!*

Now I can't breathe.

Naw. They paroled me.

Well, we ain't out a it yet.

What's it to you?

Why, I guess so.

Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.

Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.  Look for yourself.

Joad. Tom Joad.

Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?

Anything like work aroun' here?

Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.

He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.

What you figger to do?

If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.

We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.

I dunno. Payin' five now.

No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.

Lissen, I heard that before--

But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?

Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?

Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.

I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.

Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.

Take her with you!

No plants.

Sure. We aim to.

Maybe that's jus' what he done.

Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.

I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 

Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 

I'm ready.

That's right. And douse some in it.

Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.

Ya say we're acrost?

Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 

No.

Granma's dead.

You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.

Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?

I kinda thought so. Felt like it.

Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.

Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?

He was a good man.

I don't understan' it, Tom.

Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?

Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.

Are you crazy?

Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.

Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.

How's Granma since we got her in the tent?

Me an' you both.

I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!

Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.

Won't they ketch us?

Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?

I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!

Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!

I seen 'em b'fore you did.

Now don't you go monk'ing--

Morning.

Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.

Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.

I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

Yes I do.

It's what I do.

Whatever I can get away with.

Fine, Bob. How are you?

Insane.

Overflowing with love.

You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.

It's nice to see you again.

Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?

Not much else.

I'm a professional killer.

You see someone?

Yep.

Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.

As long as I get the laugh.

Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.

Like heroin?

Yes.

It's something I do...

I'll hide.

You don't understand...

I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.

Shouldn't you be taking notes?

I just know.

Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.

Out Loud?

No.

Okay.

Up on the right.

Like a club. Work less, make more.

No harm no foul.

I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!

Excellent. Here they come.

That sounds pretty interesting...

--Nooo--

We can't do our job unless he does his job.

-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.

This?

He didn't.

It's fine.

Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.

Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.

I spoke to your father the other day.

He gave me a great deal.

I was catching up with Bob Destephano.

Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...

Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.

Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.

Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --

Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?

Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?

Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?

When I was first married.

Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.

I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?

You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...

Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.

College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...

That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.

Tom.

The point was to love each other.

I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!

Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.

Is that your version of a pep talk?

Mom?

I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?

Fine -- I'll take my bath.

-- enough time tomorrow. I know.

I don't care.

Little.

Don't they believe in signs here?

You already did.

I'll take care of it.

Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!

... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?

Yeah, you know everything!!

FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!

What?... Oh baby...

What?

Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...

So do you.

Good.

Who's there?

I should be in by two.

I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.

He did, but... I think I can change his mind.

Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.

I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...

No. I was just researching. Calm down.

You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.

Okay.

Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.

No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.

Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?

I don't understa-

Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?

I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...

Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?

It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.

Well, I am going to go after lunch.

I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.

You too, Diane.

It isn't right to make him suffer...

Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.

Sure. As long as she don't mind.

Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.

We should be fine, then.

Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.

Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.

I don't know if I can with my leg.

There's no hurry. Take you time.

No, I'm just not that hungry.

I understand...

I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.

Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?

Where did you learn all this stuff?

See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.

Dragon book. Compiler design.

I want it.

...as they snoop onto us.

Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?

I'm gonna hit you!

Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.

Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?

Yeah, mom?

Revenge.

No. No one special.

Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.

Blow me.

I told you, I don't play well with others.

Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.

Razor and Blade.

You're the moron that's been invading my turf?

P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.

Are you challenging me?

You're not gonna win.

Okay. I'll copy it.

Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...

I know, I know who wrote it.

Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.

Razor and Blade! They're flakes!

It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.

Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.

Yeah.

I think we've got something.

Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.

As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?

You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.

D'you bring those Crayola books?

Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?

I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!

Hey, it's me.

Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?

What, it left a note?

Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.

Sh, sh sh sh sh.

I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.

So?

Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.

Yeah.  Should be on the road.

All right.

My parents are going to come home early tonight.

I don't know Brady.

You don't owe me anything.

Not without Jamie.

Brady! Come with us.

Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?

Its too late.

How do you know their not?

Drive Carefully.

Al here lost his boy 10 years back.

You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.

But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.

Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.

Oh Rachel!

I can't.

No.

You knew. You just didn't care.

Hi Jamie.

I don't want to look pushy.

Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.

Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.

Okay, bye.

Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.

No problem, Sheriff.

This is 132, over.

I'll be there in 5 minutes.

Yeah in the trunk of my squad.

Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...

Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.

Dear God.

Evil.

Car trouble?

Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 

Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?

Hi, Dad. What happened?

We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.

I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.

That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.

Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.

The guys think I'm too smart.

Of course.

I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.

Bye.

What's this big, big news?

Come with me.

Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.

May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...

He isn't a man.

Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...

More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.

I think you have too much to do tomorrow.

The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...

Same time, same place.

After the Jack-O-Lantern.

There is no such thing.

We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?

Yes.

There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.

You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!

He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.

Look at this.

Oh, is that what it is?

...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?

Yeah, I, we both live downtown.

Uh...

Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.

No, he called late last night.

Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?

Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?

What time do you get off?

Uh-huh.

Yes.

This time I really think I have something.

Let's take a look.

No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.

The hospital?  What kind of tests?

Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.

Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.

...ex-husband on the street the other day.

What are you doing here?

Oh, what, in this section of town?

Yes, I do.

Well, i-if-if you have some free time...

Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.

Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.

Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.

Bye.

Oh.

Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.

Poor Hannah.

Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!

I didn't sleep all night.

If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!

Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!

Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.

I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.

Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.

Are you in love with someone else?

No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!

Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.

It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!

Oh, honey!

Mom, come out!

No, nothing.

Absolutely.

Mmm...

Yeah.

They're in the basement.

Oh, Frederick!

I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!

I can't take this anymore.

I'm saying it now!

Like what?!  What?

How are you?

Really?

Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.

Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.

Thanks, thanks.

Wow!

I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?

With a, with a stranger?  With a--

Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.

Will you just tell me one thing?

When does Frederick ever come with her?

He's not a loser at all!

Here.  Be careful with those.

Singing?

Really?

I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--

Hmm!

Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.

You're grateful, but you resent me.

I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.

You want some?

No!

And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?

Yeah.  Me, too.

We didn't hit it off.

How are you?

Oh, nothing much.  You know...

No, well...I've been trying to write.

Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?

Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.

You've always hated my taste in the past.

Yeah.

Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?

...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.

Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.

Oh, who cares?

Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.

Okay.

God.

Oh...

...which I did not get.

April?

Take our literature...

...you don't have to think.

<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?

Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?

I hereby acknowledge that...

Or, perhaps...

Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?

Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...

Rich, comic book freaks.

And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 

You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....

~Don't shoot, G-Men..."

...Let's see the pigs, please.

Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?

Show me the Pigs.

The children...?

He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 

Try Barney Clark.

He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.

I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...

I can make you rich.

Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...

....what...? 

Starling, I've ordered you to shut...

Starling...?

...standard issue...

Am I on that case, sir...? 

Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...

I'm going to work for your reinstatement...

I don't <u>think</u> so...

You nervous...?

A wonderful country...

Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...

You have taken over his offices, is that not so?

You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.

I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.

Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...

...yes, yes, yes...

We got KittyKat...

And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...

I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...

...what has she done to harm you...?

That's what I should do.  Tell me why?

What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?

You got a lot of people love you, Starling.

You goin to shoot yourself? 

...<u>what</u>...?

Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...

...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...

Then we cannot go.

Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...

I'm sure I don't know who you mean.

What shape is the scar?

The great and <u>beautiful</u>...

Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...

Dottore Fanelli...

Brazilian. 

...yes, yes, yes....

I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.

I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?

What is your point?

I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...

Because?

Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.

Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.

I'm not really a--Does it count if...

Uh, yeah, that's...wow.

Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...

Wha-at?  What is it?

I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?

This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!

It's been known to happen.

Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?

That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.

Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.

Shoot.

It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.

Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?

I don't know, it was okay, I guess.

Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?

Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.

Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.

I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?

Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.

Heather? Wha...

Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.

Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?

Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...

Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...

Heather.

Is she dead?

Give me the clipboard.

Give it up girl!

No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.

I didn't. Cherry.

Maybe it's time for a vacation.

A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.

Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.

Yeah, great.

Chick-en.

It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.

That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.

My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.

Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.

French.

Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.

Oh.

Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.

Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?

Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....

Did not.

How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?

I was just making it more special.

Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.

Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....

You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?

Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.

What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?

Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.

Sure. Ciao.

What's that?

playfully shoves his hand away.

Look who I've found!

Is it hurting, dear?

comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.

I'm not hungry.

You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!

These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?

Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.

stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.

Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.

Saint Mario!

This . . .

That idiot boarder?

Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.

I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.

Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.

I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!

It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.

Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.

The way you just looked at me...

I'm stumped.

Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?

What?

Really? Do tell.

I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.

Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.

Allison Dormere. Your intern.

I said she's been missing for-

I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.

What's that?

Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.

Gwen, my wife's dead.

Shut up and play darling. Your turn.

This isn't happening.

Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?

No please make yourself at home.

Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.

Wow you are out of it.  

All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?

Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:

No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-

I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?

Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.

One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?

They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?

I was in the can, for Chrissake.

Allen?  He... he's okay?

He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.

We can hope.  You still have your job, right?

How recently?

Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.

Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.

I took a loan on my car and my computer.

Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.

I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..

Mister LaPlante...

Spanish kinda guys!

I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?

I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.

I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.

OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?

Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?

If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...

Thanks.  Thanks, pal.

It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.

You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....

Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'

It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.

Unprofessional.

You're sitting on your ticket.

It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.

Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.

Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?

No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.

What?

Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.

We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --

We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...

Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.

What about?

So this really does the trick, eh?

Well, it's for a woman.

Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.

-- institution.

No, no, no, no.

That would be stupid.

-- a sense of proportion.

Yeah, that was easy.

Isn't that always the way?

Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.

Bye, Neil!

I'm thirsty.

A man scared me.

Did Daddy tease you?

Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.

The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.

I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.

Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.

Stop knowing me so well.

You wanted furniture too, didn't you?

You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.

Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.

It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.

What?

Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.

<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?

No.

I know someone else who's sensitive.

Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.

Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.

There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.

Did you lock the garage door?

There might be some extras in the garage.

I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!

Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?

There's always an excuse, isn't there?

No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.

Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.

What for, dickweed?

Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?

Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!

It's a double.

Really.

Talk to me about what?

What is it?

It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.

It's circumstantial.

Lieutenant.

You didn't bring me here to talk about her.

Is that it?

Maybe he was a lousy shot.

What?

And what do you think you will find in another land?

Then it's worth the journey.

For what?

We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.

The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?

I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.

No -- I will.

I think you just like to eat dirt.

Where do you go when your mind drifts?

Aye.

Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.

Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?

I remember you.

Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?

Get out.

Conner?

Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.

What?  How?

I don't think it is a duplication.

I like my work.

It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?

It will not end tonight.

I can take care of myself.

I'll no forget you.

Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.

Fine.

I can take care of myself.

That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?

Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?

It was stolen.

What do you want to do?

I understand.

You think we should take that chance?

She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!

Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!

I'm going to my desk.

I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.

I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!

Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!

We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!

Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?

Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.

That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --

I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.

I'm not going to die for this!

The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?

We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?

How about the cop?

Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.

The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.

Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?

Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.

Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.

Yeah.

First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.

Be quiet!  Listen!

We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.

You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.

We're hungry.  You're going to cook.

I don't know what you're talking about.

He said something about a girl --

Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.

Go, Chief.

I know the one.

Go.

You have her cell number?

Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.

Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --

Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!

Goddamned small town bullshit.

Chief, it's Mikkelson.

Where's the office?

Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.

We're okay.

I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?

They're still in the house.

Yes.

How do I reach him?

These disks . . . where are they?

Yes, it is a calamity for us all.

Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.

I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.

We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.

Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.

It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.

What did you overhear?

I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.

They can go where they want. They are in charge now.

We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.

No.

No, sir.

At least.

You have no whiskey?

Take the river road back. It is clear.

What is it?

Just give me a moment to get your keys.

When will they be here?

Give me the phone.

For supplies, you drive.

I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.

I would never do that.

Call, sir?

He will be here.

They have him in the lobby, go quickly.

I will see what I can do.

I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.

Move? Where to?

He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?

Jean Baptiste!

Where are you hurt, son?

I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.

No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.

No, Odette says he's in shock.

He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?

Yes.

What?

I will follow on the next plane. Go.

Anais, it is so good to see you.

You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.

Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.

Many beers.

Where?

-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --

So what stopped her?

-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --

Not at all!

Oh dear.

-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?

C'mon.

Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.

Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?

Three times, to be exact.

Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.

Up here --

Prove it.

Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --

Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?

Most fun I've had all day.

Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.

Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.

-- listen to the man --

Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --

I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.

Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.

Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?

My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.

Really? Well, let it rip.

Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.

A simple leak, if it's okay with you.

Where is she?

Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?

-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.

My wife. Where were we?

Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!

Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.

Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.

I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --

Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.

Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.

Good way to get your head blown off.

Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."

Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.

I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.

Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?

Why not?

Believe me, we need to.

The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.

He would have been back by now.

-- ten.

Melissa...?

What's the matter?

What was her name?

What will they tell you?

Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?

It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.

We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.

I didn't do anything, mommy.

No it won't - no it won't!

Where is she?

Sure.  Did you see the others?

It's dark!  I can't breathe!

Daddy help!

Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...

Yeah I'll look into that tonight.

Aubrey knows more about us than you think.

To our family.

Or what she was worth.

What?

She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.

Ok.

Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!

Are you ok?

She's gone!

No...  NO!

I'm ok.

I'm all right...

I could see if I detect the presence of something.

Yeah, they told us this was the best.

White meat will be fine...

Yes, I am.

Oh, that's nice...

Did you remove anything in the cellar!

What are you getting at!

It will not take long...

It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...

I didn't do anything...God saved her...

Yes, they are.

It was nailed to the cellar wall.

What?

Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.

You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?

Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?

And why are you back?  Why are we here?

Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.

Then tell me what to do.

So where is it?

Where?

Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?

Right.  Right!

Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...

Taken what?

Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.

No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...

Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.

Unh-unh.

Hey, that's what makes the world go round.

Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?

Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.

Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?

Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."

Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--

Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?

Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.

"He kicks up at anything he hears.

Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...

You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.

Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.

Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?

God go with you, sister.

Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...

That's what you theenk.

Never, why do you ask?

I'll bring my entire repertoire...

Oh, I'm so sorry...

Somebody robbed the Vatican.

You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.

Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.

And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.

Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...

If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.

Baseball, why?

Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?

That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?

If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?

Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!

You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!

I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...

The Dancing Dingus!

Sharp.

I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.

It's hardly the same --

Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...

Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --

I know they're gonna buy that stock --

Mind if I join you?

-- or lack thereof?

Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!

Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...

Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --

No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!

Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.

Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --

Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --

Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!

Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?

Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!

Says who?!

Forty-eight years...

What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!

Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --

Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --

But, buddy, you were --

Say, that was a swell idea!

Yes sir...

Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.

Well, why don't ya read it.

-- tough titty toenails!

Yeah?

I --

Well, I'm a college graduate --

No, sir.

Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.

It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --

She sits down.

The mark notices.

She is!

Thank you for waking me.

A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."

Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.

You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.

You don't believe in it?

I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?

It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.

No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.

We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children.

It'll wait.

Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.

One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"  What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists.

Yes, thank you.

I'm sorry...

But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.

I love Fort Holland.

I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.

I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.

It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...

I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.

Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.

No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.

Why?

Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!

Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.

That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.

Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?

Got a meeting uptown.

Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.

I wasn't star--

I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.

Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.

That one.

You think I --

What's on your mind? Don't --

Elena, what are you're talking about?

Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --

Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.

I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.

I'm not.

We're not going anywhere.

The phone's out.

Paul? Yeah. You think --

Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?

Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --

Ben--

After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?

Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?

What?

Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.

If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.

Nothing.

Jesus all right enough!

Yeah.

-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --

Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.

I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.

Thanks for the advice Dave.

It was lovely!

I suppose we'll make an appearance.

My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.

Yeah. You?

Mom. Are you ok?

Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --

I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.

It's not a bother.

It's really quite all right.

I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --

That's right.

Um, Libbets Casey.

Major.

Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?

You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?

No!

The Idiot?

Hey, it's a sellable skill.

That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.

Out.

Sure.  Twinkie?

Maybe we can just watch some TV.

Wendy!

Watching what?

With who?

Charles, what time is it?

What time is it?

Hey Sandy.

I have to go to the bathroom.

Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.

Huh?

That's nice. Are you drunk?

But they're so boring.  All small stuff.

The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.

Twelve years younger.

Okay.

I don't remember.

About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.

Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?

Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.

We just gotta catch the bastard, right?

Has her books in it.

And something else that might interest you.

Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.

That's right.

That's right.

She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.

Even the best make mistakes.

You know what about.

Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...

You know I remember that.

Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...

What are we thinking?

Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...

There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.

She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.

What kind of stuff?

You don't know.

He.  Well, he...

There's nothing more to talk about.

You mean we are not children of Satan?

I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.

It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.

I have. Or there would be twice as many.

You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?

What you are? You would be something other than you are?

Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.

I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.

You're a liar. But you upset my plans.

Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.

The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.

Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.

It is! Take the back stairwell -

It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.

You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --

They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.

How devilishly clever.

Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.

Yes...

What do you mean?

I can't.

Paris? You came from Paris?

Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!

I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.

I don't pretend to know.

Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.

I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!

You finish her - if you feel so much -

In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.

What are you saying?

She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...

Are you mad????

That's all past, Lestat.

Perhaps lucky for both of us.

Oh, that rumour about crosses?

Can a vampire feel love?

Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...

Au contraire, monsieur, I have.

Yes...

What the hell would you call this?

Who? Who is here?

Stupid. What were you thinkng?

That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.

Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.

What are you doing in my closet?

Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --

Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...

No, I'm the King of the World.

Yes.

The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.

I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.

No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.

Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.

What do we do?

Come on, you can make it.

Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.

Ray, we're just friend.

Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.

Who?

Wait, it's Nancy --

What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.

It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...

Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.

Hey --

I don't know, but I'm starving.

I said we start having fun. And that means now.

Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!

Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.

He's probably the only one who can help us.

Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?

Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.

See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.

So why are you still here?

Drunk again?

Good winds and bad winds!

My friend -- what can one say --

M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.

How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..

Poor Cathy --

I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.

They shall not hurt you

And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?

Thea is an orphan.

I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now - I don't know 

It was, the plague

Miss Wollsten!

) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints  the way you can turn the truth into a lie --

Yes?

I don't understand you.

You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?

She's not too well.

Hero?

But that should make you like her.

Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?

I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --

No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it - he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.

Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?

I hate to do this, fella.

What did . . .

Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?

It isn't me!

No.

Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.

There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 

Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.

Where is she?

Well, naturally. Of course.

I want you to take a good look at that face.

Not a soul.

You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.

What's that book you've got there?

It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.

Oh, look at this. Champagne!

That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.

Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.

Kind that will help you find the answers, George.

Uh-huh.

Yes, sir.

Don't hurt my ear again!

Oh, George.

Oh . . .

Maybe you were born older, George.

Still after that first million before you're thirty.

Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.

Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.

Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.

Huh?

Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.

About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.

Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.

This way.

I'd like to do that.

I'll take chocolate.

You've passed me on the street almost every day.

Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.

You may kiss my hand.

I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.

Didn't you tell her?

Thank you.

Don't you like her?

Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.

My baby.

Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.

Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!

Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.

You going to the lighthouse?

How fast is enough?

Soon, dark eyes, soon.

Is she responsible for the punch?

They're moving pretty fast.

Yee-hah!

I was counting on hours.

Too hot in the lighthouse?

We're hung up on something.

Anyone got another set of sails?

Can you get us a line?

Happy to do it.

Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.

Could you just keep that crowd back, please?

But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.

Every day?

You'll have to make up your own mind about that.

You stay right here.  You're going in with me.

Pop.  I'm sorry.

Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.

You don't make enough.

That's it.

My boss and your boss.  Sure.

And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.

It's good with coffee.

Nothing, huh?

It was bad, wasn't it.

Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.

No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.

Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....

Going out.

Mike's out there.

I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?

We have to do something.

It's still a good idea.

Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....

Go ahead, whatever it's worth.

10-4,   soon as I can raise him.

That's what he said.

Dad!  Dad!

That's you.

Shh.  Shhh....

It's all right, we're okay.

Seventeen.  She's a senior.

I will, I will.

Nope.

None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.

They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.

Huh?

Mike?  Our Mike?

I'm going.

Figure they split?

Power line.

Is there something I don't know about?

I'll be right there.  Wait up.

I'm not sure I can.

That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.

Name it.

Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....

No.

Okay, okay.  Close your door.

What the hell is he doing?

So?  So?

I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.

With those camera lights and...

They're acting very strange suddenly.

I guess.

I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.

Get out of here!

Just put your mask on.

Yes.

Nothing.

Make up your mind.

It's all right, baby.  We're safe...

God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?

Yes?

No.

Sounds wonderful.

Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.

Me, too.

... Mean through the tubes?

Hydrophobia...

I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!

I don't understand.

It's all controlled from the Control Room.

Michael, you're not going down there.

But you --

I'm  fine.

Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?

Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.

No!

Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!

The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...

I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!

Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.

Should be coming out of it soon.

We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.

And here I thought I was charming you.

Brian, he's coming around!

They still seem nervous.

Well, wait till you see the rest.

Why you sonuvabitch...

I don't know, what else is there?

I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?

What, hon?

He's diving!

SEAN!

Hold still, damn it!

Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!

What?

It's disappeared.

Hey.

Hey, I don't want to hear.

So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?

It's large enough...

Five hundred yards.

No way.

All right, hit those lights too.

... I'll go to McDonalds.

Who's grown up?

Don't hurry back.

Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.

That's what grandmas are for.

Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.

But you always let me....

Yes, you can make sandwiches....

Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....

It sure is....

I thought artists worked with their subconscious....

Then don't come any closer.

I have work....

I don't know....

Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?

You caught me....

Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....

Bang sticks are like yelling at it....

Serves you right.  Will you please stop....

I won't....

You can stay in my room.

I didn't.

I'll miss you....

Mother....

It picked Sean...It killed your father....

It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....

I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....

I have to get this finished.

I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....

Why'd you come out here?

Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?

Boss' day off...Take the wheel....

Sure you can....

One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....

Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....

Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....

A big one....

Won't you get in trouble...?

Just like that?

Yes I can....

Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....

She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....

I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....

Stop busting my hump....

May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....

They put bombs on dolphins....

It's not a bad life, Jake....

Holy shit!

Don't say anything about this to my mother....

As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....

My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....

You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....

What?

As long as he's been here....

Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....

I am...You must know something about him....

Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....

Screw you, Jake....

The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....

No way....

Don't flatter yourself.... 

In a few minutes....

Oh, Jake... 

I'm training to....

Good night, Polly....

No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-

Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..

I think you're here all day.

The <u>dogs</u>?

What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.

Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?

Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.

I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?

I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.

Listen to me saying what?

You looked like you did?

Just makes to so God damned mad ..

Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..

Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?

I'm going up to the institute.

This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.

I guess by the bed.

Bits.

You ain't going in alone?

Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?

He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.

No.

No, Sir.

We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..

Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?

Three or four.

I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..

How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..

Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.

What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?

No. Except he smoked. Like you.

No.

Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?

Yes.

No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..

No problem. I'm not in a hurry.

I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"

Of course I would ..

Do you pray?

Have you known her long?

How d'you know what I'm like?

It's not possible right now.

Then why didn't he kill me?

The man from the F.B.I.

You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..

I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.

Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.

He's not that bad of a guy ..?

I'm already walking. Where is it?

He has? .. What's he doing here?

A derelict.

One of the accountants.

No.

Listen to me, it's over.

"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...

Just be friendly and say "no comment."

Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.

Same to you.

Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.

Hi.

And I am...

Sure.

What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.

Plus, you could use that commission.

You don't have to explain.

Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.

What?

Good night.

Well, when you wonder, ask me.

Tell me -- let me help --

...my soul or something. _ 117.

No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.

But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.

Good.

That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.

Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.

I'll give it everything.

Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?

So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?

We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.

Okay.

Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.

Oh my God.

Great word.  Towel?

You.

You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.

Good deal, man.

No.

No.

I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?

Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.

No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.

Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --

Fine.

I missed ya.  What can I say?

What --

Jerry Maguire.  SMI.

Jerry.  You two will be together forever.

Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!

What DO you stand for???

The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.

I came here to let you go. _ 27.

Dick.

I'm not your brother!

Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.

I'm scared.  What is it?

Can you be quiet?

What's a bad idea?

Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.

So do you.

Oh, don't worry about that.

Nothing.

Eric...

I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?

I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...

I would completely support that.

What about Eric?

DAD!

I know. I know. I want to look for him too.

The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.

Baryonyx?

We should take it with us to signal any planes.

Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...

NO!

He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?

Yeah.

You should.

No. I couldn't see.

No we're not.

Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.

Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.

There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.

But you never came across just one.

No.  I feel something.

It doesn't matter what I think.

Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.

It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.

The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.

After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.

You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?

This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.

Operations building.  Far end of the street.

There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.

She's nuts.

Oh, my God.

Our chance to do what?

We're sure as hell not going back out there"

It'll hold!

What's that?

So the truth is more important to you than your life?

Four, counting the one in the chamber.

They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.

Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.

I believe in him.

Oh, no!

That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.

No.

Can the kid walk?

Damn!

Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.

The door security systems are shutting down.

Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!

Uh - - about two million.

Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?

Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?

Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?

These are dilated.  Take a look.

They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

Why?

Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.

They died together?

They smell.

They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.

Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....

Small versions of adults, honey.

Say again?

We're out of a job.

Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!

- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -

And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.

I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.

Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.

The fences are electrified, right?

They're not here.

Why not?

Yeah.

Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!

Hola, bienvenido

Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.

Because he's like me.  He's a digger.

I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.

Thank you.

Oh, yeah - - great.

Tim, are you okay?

Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.

Yes it is.

I doubt it.

You got me.

But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.

Not without massive sequence gaps!

Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.

You want to talk about this?

Kids get scared.

You're sure?!

There's gotta be something - -

For today, I guarantee it.

Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!

Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.

No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.

I guess we'll just have to evolve too.

All night.

Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!

Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!

John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.

There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!

I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.

Excellent.

That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!

What?

I'm afraid I am gonna fall!

Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.

Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?

And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?

Who is this? What's going on?

What about that other guy?

And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?

You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.

What?

I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.

Video store?

Because everyone knows he's guilty...

One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.

This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?

Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...

That doesn't make sense.

So what do we do?

I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.

I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.

It was Krueger, wasn't it?

Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.

Except this victim got away. I wonder if --

I don't know... but I think he's pissed.

About ten minutes.

For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...

My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.

Up there.

I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.

Success or nothing?

Yes.

What an extraordinary request!

Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.

I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.

Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.

Sit down, Kafka.

Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?

Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.

And you believe everything the authorities tell you.

The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.

Tonight?

And you ...?

I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.

What of it?

My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?

Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?

Why were you given notice?

Usually.

First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.

I don't know.

That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.

When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...

It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.

What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?

He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department

Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.

It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.

She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.

My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.

Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!

They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.

Amerika for us!

Now Ann ...

These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!

Father ... Father!

All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.

There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.

Leave it, Ann.

Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!

Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!

I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!

Nab- Let's get it over with.

Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.

Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --

She was with you after she left Frank.

It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?

Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --

No.

Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?

I guess he figured it was better.

No, that's not --

Here please.

Yes.

Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.

My name's John Klute.

-- Tuscarora --

You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.

-- OK --

You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.

No.

It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --

Try some other ways. 

Not much point to this, is there?

Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --

When?

What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.

I don't like getting splashed.

My bed.

Drop it.

You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?

Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!

Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.

I am.

I don't think so.

They don't scare me any more.

No. I'm sore.

It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.

I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.

It's got to make sense some way.

Yeah.

I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?

Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.

I'll be sending you on a report tonight.

It's not so bad.

What's in it?

I wanted to give it to you first.

She told me.

Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?

I think she's trying that.

Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?

He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.

Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.

I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.

Nobody's seen that.

Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.

Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.

Yes sir, we know he --

Do you like to be with your mommy?

Playing.

Greatest...

The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?

Soon.  I told you before, very soon.

I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.

You got a letter from mom.

Billy, don't eat with your fingers.

In a minute...

That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.

I hate it.

I'm allergic to onions.

I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.

You're no bargain either, pal.

See you in the morning light...

Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.

Why does he decide?

Overruled.

Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.

Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.

Objection!

While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.

Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--

Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.

No.

I...I don't know...

We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.

Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.

Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.

Ted, I'm leaving you.

Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.

I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--

I don't know...

Fine.

You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.

Yeah, well he did, didn't he.

Ted, do you love him?

I don't think so, Jim.  Maybe I shouldn't have--

Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--

I mean it Ted, you're running this one.

I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.

Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.

He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.

Kramer...

What?!?

I don't believe you.

Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.

Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.

I'm going to take it.

Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.

Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?

I know....I know.

Six.

It's going to cost.

Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.

Look, Ted, all I--

What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.

Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.

No.

Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.

No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.

I told her you're doing a

Sure.

What?

Any day.

Uh, huh...

Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...

Ted, I just heard...

Ha!  You tell me.

A moment.

Kham, Holiness.

Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.

Again?

It is alright, Father.

No!

To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.

General Chiang.

The Sera monks have surrendered?

The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.

The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.

Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.

If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?

He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.

At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.

I accept it. What is suffering?

Answer. 

I do not know, Holiness.

Look here!

Can India help us?

Britain?

Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?

Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.

Good day.

I leave tomorrow.

You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.

Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.

I have smarter men.

Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.

You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.

I would not know. Maybe.

Ahh.

Ahh.

The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.

We have.

Eliminate you.

I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.

Completely.

Too young?

We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.

My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.

Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.

<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.

'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.

<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!

What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.

You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.

Is everything a big fucking joke to you?

I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.

Raincheck.

I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.

Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.

'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.

And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?

No.

Could we have intercourse?

Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...

Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.

Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?

But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?

Just gotta pull it a little tighter.

Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.

Maybe.  Don't mush it.

You're mushing it a little around the--

Keep firing!

Take him.

Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!

White perch.

Don't count on it.  We better take him out.

You too.

Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.

Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.

We're staying in <u>tents</u>?

<u>Apologize</u>?

<u>That</u> was a bust.

Look.

I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.

Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?

Liar?

Shitbutt?

'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.

Get me out!

You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.

Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.

Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.

Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?

Yes sir. I can find it by myself.

Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.

Good morning, Mr. Crawford.

I hope so. They haven't posted anything.

Not yet.

He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.

You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.

He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.

I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.

You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?

Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.

Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.

Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.

Not lately. But maybe someday.

Sometimes you do.

We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?

Did you do those drawings, Doctor?

All that detail, just from memory...?

A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.

Then please - do this test for me.

What's that, Dr. Lecter?

Why? Do you know something about him?

Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?

I don't know. Is it?

Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?

Who killed your patient?

That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?

That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.

Did he try to?

There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.

Yes, Doctor. Please.

How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?

Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.

No. We just -

Yes...! They were screaming.

Yes...

Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?

You know I can't make that promise.

You want to see a violation? This is a violation...

I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?

It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.

Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.

We leave in the morning?!

I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!

Well that is to be expected. My father...

Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."

There was no letter.

"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.

"Some"?

Yes. Yes, I will.

Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.

That is sedition! Treason!

I ought to have you whipped from this fort!

We don't.

This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.

I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.

Tradin' your skins in Castleton?

It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.

Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.

The decision is final.

Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 

Atten-hut!

When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.

That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.

Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?

However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.

My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.

Granted, Monsieur.

Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.

Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?

Intelligence may not be the right word...

There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...

Can you fix it?

Fuck your orders!

I got hung up!  Try this!

Roger...  More light, Sixpack...

After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.

Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?

I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?

You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.

Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...

...I'd really have to show it to you.

Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---

It bit me!

Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.

And it killed Bo?

Beautiful.

I realize you must have gone through hell--

Russian.

Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.

What music?  There ain't no music.

I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.

I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.

He's tanking on us...

What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.

We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...

What are you going to do to him?

Let's hope it holds.

Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.

Sixpack...

I ought to smack your face!

Hardly.

Probably no longer than four weeks.

Well, it's still a good idea.

I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?

I still will, if you don't mind.

They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?

Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.

I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.

Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.

It's a Samoan pub.

Like antiques.

If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.

Where're the others?

Yeah, Bazza, what?

It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.

No Harry, you can't.

I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.

Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?

Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.

This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.

Furry muff, let's go.

What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.

There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.

I didn't touch him, he just passed out.

Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.

Out the back.

Hit the fuckers.

Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?

You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?

Right as rain.

He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.

A hundred grand.

I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.

Do you want me to draw a picture?

What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.

I'll only be a minute.

Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.

That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.

What do you mean?

I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--

So?

I can't take any more school.

So?

You think I can't learn that?

I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.

I mean, follow orders, sir.

Yes, sir.

Thank you, sir.

He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--

Thank you, Sergeant Major.

Thank you, Sergeant Major.

If I had I wouldn't have gone in.

You're testing me?

Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.

Yeah, this is Skinny.

You got to investigate. No question about it.

You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--

You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.

--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.

Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.

Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".

Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?

No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?

You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.

Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--

Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--

"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"

Dad, can I talk to you about track?

I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--

I finished that. I'm just messing around.

Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.

You own this place?

He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!

I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.

Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--

If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--

Yeah?

She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.

Seriously, I think we should get married.

Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.

Pleased to meet you.

Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.

Appreciate it, sir.

Nice to meet you, Ma'am.

The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.

I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.

Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--

I have some friends who have had a accident--

We was crossin' the river--

They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--

Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]

Buddy Deeds. He had a way.

'57, 1 believe--

--Santiago.

Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.

Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--

Sounds great. Where do I sign up?

You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?

I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--

Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.

It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--

Maybe you're just getting less patient.

Well, you hire illegals--

Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?

I don't mean Fernando.

Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.

Not if I can help it.

Okay? He's not here?

What was your deal with him?

I'm surprised he bothered with it.

We haven't talked since high school.

Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.

A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--

So she tells me three times a week.

Most people did, yeah.

I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.

You know the other day, you asked why I came back?

I came back 'cause you were here.

She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.

Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--

He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.

Yeah--

I'm going over to the other side.

That the problem, son?  You Slow?

I haven't seen anybody come by.

So when did Buddy leave?

Uh-huh.

Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.

You heard right.

That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.

Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.

Right.

I know him.  I saw him.

So tell me where Nix is buried.

You'll do more.than that.

It's him... it's him.

It was me.

What is he?

Yes...

I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.

But obviously you still care what happens to him.

Do you?

You haven't seen anything yet.

I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.

Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.

You didn't marry him for love.

It was more than that, I think.

Swann said he could do stuff, yes.

And they all came...

Hang on!

I think so.

Harry-?

Somebody killed him.

I heard he was the best.

Fuck you.

Mr. D'Amour?

It's one in the afternoon.

Mine.

I don't think the dead much care.

Swann's wife.

Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.

You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.

A ticket home,

No.

Yes.

Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.

What about?

I won't say anything.

Yes...

What?

You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.

Sure.  Vivovich.

I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.

You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.

They'll never find out.

Now I'm going to have to kill you.

He deserved it.

Didn't know you read minds.

Is that all?

No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.

There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.

Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.

What about Philip Swann?

He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.

Is he the Puritan?

And he's dead?

Fuck you.

No!

Yes.

Bob, it's me.

Oh.

Ok.

I see them every morning.

Yeah, you don't remember?

I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.

You're possessive.

Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...

It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.

When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.

But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.

That lunch was the worst, huh.

Tomorrow.

That's what you said the other night.

I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.

Yes.

Zoe, come say hello to your father...

That's ok.

Bye.

Do you want I send it to your room?

No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.

That's ok, you'll figure it out.

I gotta go to work.

Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...

I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.

Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?

I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?

Do you think they have a room here?

No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.

Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?

I can't believe Will killed him.

You need to believe in something besides yourself.

Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.

And how would you describe him?

On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?

Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.

It's nothing.

This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.

I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.

You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.

You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.

Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.

Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.

Yes.  We won, that's right.

Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.

Peter Kelson?

I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.

I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.

On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?

I think you gave me the wrong one.

Please, the children.

Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.

I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.

And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?

I'm going to look around.

That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.

We're going to do this.

Maybe that's my problem.

You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.

And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"

And what's that mean?

Not a lot.

You are the younger of two...

I think it's gonna be a waste of time.

I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.

It's Detective Smythe.

Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.

Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.

So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.

Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.

He's looking right at me.

How're you doin' today?

Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.

Dad around?

You're the one always turning your nose up at me.

So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?

That's ridiculous.

When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.

He's fine.

You love to pose so much, let's see it again.

I mean, I'm having a good time with you...

Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.

To do what you love.

Always on my ass, anyway.

Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.

Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?

Chances are there's still a chance.

Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?

I wouldn't know.

Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.

Lucky.

It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.

He works at a bank.

I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.

I'd just tell my sister, Lena.

So that means I have to ride with you.

Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.

Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.

With a jacked-up attitude.

I know, right?

Quit.

Right here.

Quincy...

The "man" again.

So you fucked around to prove a point!

I never asked you to choose.

Kiss my ass.

No.

Getting there.

Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...

Find.

What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.

Better late than never, right?

What?

You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.

I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.

Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.

No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.

Happy.  And he won't want to see you.

We were just studying.

Okay.

Said he'd be home later.

So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.

I'm also good enough to go pro.

Okay...

Tell me what?

I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.

Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.

I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.

You want me to fuck off?

Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.

You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --

-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?

Oh that's good.

Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --

I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --

I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --

I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --

YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.

GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?

-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?

And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?

Was it a boyfriend of yours?

You don't have a boyfriend?

You just move in here?

I'm a bit of a slob myself.

You and your boyfriend have a party last night?

Okey-doke.

This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --

What's that stand for?

yeah, good, ok.

Well...is that illegal?

Bye.

I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.

No, no.

...yeah...

What?

I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --

No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --

Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --

Wanna kiss me, Jim?

Yes.

They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --

I should maybe go to the bathroom.

I don't know.

-- Richard.

If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.

No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...

Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.

That's confidential information, little man.

No Can Do.

No.

I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.

Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"

I ain't fuckin with you --

Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.

What's up?

Fine.  Phil, you still there?

Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --

And I'm listening avidly, fellow.

Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --

Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --

You do?

Where is he?

No.

She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.

-- memory?

I've seen it before.

What?  Say it again...walking in the car?

Is this 509-9027?

-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?

Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --

In aid of what?

An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?

I'm quietly judging you.

He passed away.

Not a problem.

...are you Phil...?

Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...

Yeah.

Mmm.

I don't think, he can't...

The door was open, I got a call --

You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?

No one else in here?

What's this, how did this happen?

No.

I didn't hear anything.

Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --

-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.

All your other fluzzies?

You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.

I won't.

I got in trouble at school.

Are you alright?

For 25.  Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright --

I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!

She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.

I'm a bad person.

No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....

How long with Ellen?

Do you have any children with anyone?

I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?

Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?

Hello.  Is Claudia here?

Are you her boyfriend?

No.  But I probably will get a call back.

Like what?

What's MOW?

I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --

No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --

If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?

Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --

-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---

The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --

...I don't....

Yeah.

Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.

Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?

I gotta go to the bathroom.

You're late, not me.

Sure.

Go to bed.

It's ok.

Yes.

....Why does he do it...?

I have money.

I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.

This happens....this is something that happens.

That is good.

Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.

D'Artagnan.

Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.

Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?

Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?

Shut up, knave!

Making the key to the throne.

Soon enough.  Here we are.

Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.

Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!

You grow fond of him.  That's good.

But -- what is Porthos doing?

He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.

So what has changed?

We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.

They will know you helped us, if we go this way.

There are more important things than tits.

Forgiveness?

Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!

So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?

I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?

He is right, d'Artagnan.

I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.

At a ball, everyone watches the King!

It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!

None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.

Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.

It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.

Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?

I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.

Save my son, d'Artagnan.

To kill the king.

It is something I have done -- or did not do.

How did you know -- ?

Whose rooms are those?

Who came?

I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!

Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!

It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.

Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --

At least help Raoul.

You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.

Yes, your Majesty.

Get out of my way.

Yes, yes, go on.

... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.

How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?

You would do that, your Majesty?

Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --

Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?

What do you need?

So what?

Don't worry -

I didn't hit shit!

Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.

When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...

I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.

Did he harm the girl?

Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.

He said he was following up some lead.

Who is it?

You're the mysterious type, right?

You'll find out - soon enough.

Yeah.

This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--

I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!

Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?

I'm not going anywhere!

Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.

Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?

Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.

Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...

He doesn't think you run mind games on him.

Why aren't you ever alone with him?

His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?

That's when it happened?

If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?

He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.

How are Molly and the boy?

That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.

Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?

Book code?

Read it.

That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...

I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.

What else did you keep out of the papers?

No.

You said the guy down here is good.

I know...

No other possibilities?

See? You do know something about him.

After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?

...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.

I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.

'Changes?'

The activities of nocturnal animals.

No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.

Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.

Yes, are you okay...?!

I have work to do at the plant.

Was I in an accident?

My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.

Atoning, Mr. Lounds.

No. I don't want to see you.

Yes.

Oh, God.

Yes.

You'll let me go now?

Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....

Hi, Linda. ..

Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too

Why do you think I called?

Most people are.

That's true.

He only bit women so far, right?

I call him a monster.

Huh?  Will? Is that you?

I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.

I have to see somebody.

I want to see you, too.

Will?  You could come up here.

You got a deal...

Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?

My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...

I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.

Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.

Yes.

I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?

We don't know that.

With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.

...after a while.

No.

Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.

You had disadvantages.

I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...

Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.

Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?

Pretty well.

You got it.

The stewardess let me keep my headphones.

And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!

George, I hate sitcoms.

"No"?  "No" to which part??

The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!

There'll be other shots.

Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.

Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.

It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.

I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!

Yeah...

Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.

Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...

Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."

These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...

Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.

Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.

Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."

No thanks.

Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."

Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?

Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???

I can shtop whenever I want...

I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!

They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.

Okay.  You're probably right.

Then your father's a wimp.

She'll say, "Now my son is a man."

No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!

Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!

Yes, your Holiness?

Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.

Er, yes.  Speaking.

He said he's coming back!

What's your name?

It's my name.

See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!

Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.

Know what?

I know.  It's her fault.

I know but I felt like taking a shift.

I... it doesn't matter what I believe.

Hear what?

An accident?!

That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.

Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?

... Yeah.

Really?

Are they any agent?

Goddamnit!

I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.

Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?

Stand up and see for yourself.

But what if...?

More important than what is when?

Wild, isn't it?

For what?

Of the Resistance.

She would say she knows enough.

Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!

She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.

Who?

I'm not the One.

What?

Who are you?

Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.

It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.

We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.

It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.

Are you worried?

No.

She told me...

I'm going in after him.

I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.

The Oracle.

They're hacking his mind.

They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.

Neo, this has to be done!

So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.

Thanks.

Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...

Look fella...this is private...

You sure?

Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?

Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?

Can't we come with you?

Kennedy.

The number was 235 - I bet it combination.

C'mon Tony, waddaya say?

There won't be any this week.

Did you see them run!

It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?

How?

What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!

He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.

Ok, how's everything going?

What pipes?

I don't understand, where's Groppi?

My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.

For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...

Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.

C'mon Johnny.

He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.

Whatever.

Yeah, where's the rest?

Stripper?

Hostess?

Chinese food?

Yes, you did.

Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...

Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.

Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.

Well...

Anything specific?

A paper on that one too?

You're intolerable today.

Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...

Yeah, so things'll be even.

We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.

 Shut up.

Sal!... fourteen street.

I know...I know.

You what?

And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --

Yeah, speak for yourself.

Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.

Hi, Allison --

I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --

And you could care less --

A name?

Who?

I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.

It's for the party, Dad --

It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?

Do they, m'dear?

You know what I'm saying, Joe?

-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.

Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.

I thought you were buying my company.

Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.

Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.

No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.

Am I not obligated to?

What side of the industry did you say you were on?

What an odd pairing.

Of whom?

Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.

I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --

Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?

A voice?

No no, not you.

Me, too.

As close as a deal could be.

Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --

What do you mean?

'Just kidding'?

Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.

I thought this was practically a done deal --

As much as Joe's?

Please, Drew.

Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.

If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.

I don't care.

Certainly.  Goodnight.

I don't think so.  Do you?

Don't you want to hear the details?

Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.

Thanks, Quince.

Are you?

Well, that's very interesting.

Yeah.  Neat.

You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?

The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.

Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.

Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.

Didn't the family get together last night --?

And you're a nice man, Quince.

You love Allison, don't you?

How did you meet?

No.

You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.

Do you love Drew?

I'm sorry.  Do you live here?

I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.

Goodnight to you, Susan.

I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.

Patients have visitors, not doctors.

Yes.

I don't know who you are.

And is your heart beating strangely?

I loved it.

Yes!

And you can't tell me who you are.

We know all that we need to know --

Yes, that's why I said it.

And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.

Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --

I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.

It's all yours.

Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.

You tell me, Bill.

Goodnight.

Just a manner of speaking.

I told you, 'watch it'.

Yeah.

Not at all.

I think you heard me, Bill.

Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.

With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?

I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.

Get him in here.

It's time to put this person where he belongs.

I'll take it from here --  I am --

Undisclosed conflict of interest --

An indictable offense.

Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?

I'm sorry, I --

There's going to be plenty of time for that.

I'm here.

I want to have a look around before I take you.

Watch it!

In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.

I'm doing great.  You ready?

Next week?

No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?

The vodka.  What'd I tell you?

It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.

Sure.

Yes, I believe I do.

He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --

I am.  With you.

Probably.

What were you going to say?

You're not listening --

Don't get dirty, Dad --

'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --

You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.

Nothing.

Yer damn right.

Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.

Will it?...

Then what will you say?

Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?

When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.

Joe?

Where's he going?

No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.

That's why it's okay.

Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.

What's the way?

I could be her.

You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?

Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?

Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.

I think I know her.

That's it.

That must suck. All... backwards.				 *

Couple days.

This isn't my room?

Why didn't you clean it out?					 *

Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.

Leonard.

What the fuck are you doing here?

Strip!

You told me.

Yes.

That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!

I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.

Who did he go to meet?

Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.

Where is he?

This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.

I told him about your car.

Help me.

Get rid of Dodd for me.

I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!

Why not?

I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *

Are you Teddy?

You know it?

Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?

You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.

No. No, just let me think for a minute.

Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.

That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.

The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.

'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.

I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.

Wouldn't be appropriate.						*

Are you sure?

Somehow, I'll know!

Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,			* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.

Quit it!							 * 					   * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 * you're so good at it.						   *

Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.

Grieve elsewhere.

I was the kids' godfather.

So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?

Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?

You said Nazi Low-riders...?

Two main players plus three.

Make it 35.

Really?  So, what is this, a party?

And what is that?

You do business in Cuba with your husband?

Really?

Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...

I know.  And now?

Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?

I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.

And what do I do with him?

Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...

Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...

Alonzo...

White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...

We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.

Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.

What's your Miami PD badge number?

To recruit you.

From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.

Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.

Alonzo, what's goin' on?!

Goodbye.

...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.

They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...

Not French registry?

But what does your intuition tell you...?

I had to lay eyes on you.

You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...

Men, they mostly faggots.

Well, ain't no use hanging around here.

Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!

Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!

Y -- what in hell starts with Y?

Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.

For money for what?

Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...

Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.

Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?

So you could sleep! I mean Christ!

This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?

What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.

The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.

He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.

And what?

I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.

Shee-it. You believe all you read?

I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?

Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?

I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.

Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.

Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?

What?

I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.

Uh, yessir.

Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?

... and taxi fare for me.

Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.

We go through the wall?

KNOCK IT OFF!

There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.

And what do you do when you in the catacombs?

The Hilton.

Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.

I know.

Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?

But didn't have heroin.

He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.

Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.

Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.

A hundred grams.

How long?

Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

What do you mean?

Yeah!

It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.

Yeah? Where?

You can't take anything seriously.

What is it? . . . Billy?

Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...

Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?

Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.

If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?

Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...

What's your name?

Immigration's gonna love you for that.

Yeah...?

I think so. One right, two lefts...

...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...

20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.

You got a better way up?

Just do it!

Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...

"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?

Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.

Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.

I pull.

Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.

Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...

What?

But it look like a man. It... I saw it.

Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?

Don't get kinky here...

We?

No, there's...

Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!

I was just late.

Susan, we're not b-

That's camouflage...

They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!

Peter-

Peter...

No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.

Fuck! It broke the skin...

How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?

I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.

It has no nobility.

You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.

My pleasure.

I know how that can be.

Yeah, thanks.

No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.

Show me the way?

No big deal.

I don't know.

Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.

You just expect me to whip something off, that it?

You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.

You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.

I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...

Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.

--not fair?

...have to wait.

A toast?

Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?

You really think so?

I think you're right.

What?

Be my guest.

Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.

What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?

Oh, I like that tone.

What is it?

He's your client, huh?

Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?

No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?

Here it is.  Very first copy.

Mmmm.

Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...

I suppose I did.

What else?

Well, that's good, isn't?

Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.

I knew where it was.

She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.

I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.

Exactly where is she?

Not for seven more minutes.

And the check's in the mall.

I am. She is.

He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.

Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.

No.  Just as if I'd like to.

What if I pay the rent?

Do what?

Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?

Ethan Hunt.

Five, six-hundred thousand.

What wouldn't make him suspicious?

This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.

How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.

Yes?

- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.

Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --

Affirmative.

I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.

I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?

I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.

No.  You just looked as if you did.

Why did you phrase it like that?

'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'

Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.

Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.

Left jacket pocket?

Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.

You're right, of course.

Yes, Anatoly, yes.

So what do you suggest?

What about him...?

High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.

Heís putting on a show, Barnes.

This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.

Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.

All ten million.

Talking's good, walking's better.

What happened to Jim?

Who is "they?"

You're sure about this?

What about you?

Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?

Go secure.

My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know

Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?

One hour.

Why was there another team?

This whole operation was a molehunt.

I see you've been out visiting the folks.

Certainly Ethan.

I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?

Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.

Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.

I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.

Why don't you come back with me?

Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.

I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.

Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?

Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.

Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.

Where exactly is it?

We'll see.

Roger that.  Opening doors now.

What about my coat?  I'll freeze.

Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.

Very well.

When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?

Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.

- and picked us up in the States -

What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.

They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.

And a lonely ass.

Twenty minutes.

Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.

We will both have the Salad Ticino.

He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.

Well, what do you wanna talk about!

Why you drinking so much?

Bed.

No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?

More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?

It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.

You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!

Good morning, Lucy.

You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.

I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.

Let me come and talk to you.

Yes.

Maybe I should come back another time.

Seven years ago.

You really are stupid, you know that.

I'm telling you your life!

A wolf without a foot!

Take it easy.

I can't do that!

I can't!

I'll come to the wedding.

That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.

It's the best thing there is.

Yeah.

No.

No. I'm gonna wait.

Bobo, take the cart away.

Seven-thirty.

I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.

You've made me very happy, Johnny.

Who is he?

How was your plane ride?

Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.

I must ask for that back.

She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.

Well. I don't really know where to start.

I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.

Did you see it?

What sins have you to confess?

I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

I don't know.

I will. But I must find the right moment.

She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.

A miracle. Well, that's news.

You're kidding?

That's incredible.

That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?

Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.

Johnny...

None of your business.

That woman was a student of yours?

There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?

I'm a housewife.

Yes.

I'm too old for you.

You mean the whole house?

My God, it's a mansion!

Is who down there?

What would he be doing down there?

Oh. Right.

I knew she had it.

And what do you burn, apart from witches?

So how can we tell if she is made of wood?

I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.

Yes!

So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.

What do you mean?

Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.

He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.

But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?

The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

Who are they?

NI!   NI!

We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.

And not too expensive.

I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!

What!  Just a flesh wound. 

Had enough ... ?

You'll what ... ?

You're a looney.

My liege,  I am honored.

This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.

No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!

Just keep me covered.

What does it say?

I am an enchanter.

Greetings King Arthur.

A G...g...g...

Yes, I can help you with your guest.

How shall we find this cave, O Tim?

What?

It is the rabbit.

Who did we lose?

Shut up!

Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of

Why do you think she is a witch?

If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.

Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.

Blue.

Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.

He hasn't got shit all over him.

I think I could pull through, sir.

You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!

Is it?

What - the curtains?

But, Father, I don't really want any of that.

I was saved at the last minute.

Well ... I'll tell you ...

... and you'll come and get him.

Got it?

No ... just keep him in here.

Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.

What?

Oh, I see,  Right.

What is your name, handsome knight?

No, It's nothing!

No.  It's unhealthy.

Ector.

We must examine you.

Please ... we are doctors.

You got my note!

You've come to rescue me?

Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...

Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.

Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.

How about yourself?

She's hardly a full hamper herself.

You know what I mean.

There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.

But I'm the only one she trusts.

I've got my duties to attend to.

I can't let her down now, Archie.

Oh, I'm much more than that.

Mr Brown, sir --

I'm flattered you think so.

I beg your pardon?  Mama...?

She's busy.

I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?

Out of my way!

Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.

My own.

That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.

How will I know?

I need a man who knows where I am.

Yes.  I do.

You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.

She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.

There are important papers from --

In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.

To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.

It's nothing.

I wouldn't know.

Maybe, once.

Why?

I do what I do.

See what?

For once in my life, I am not the issue.

Ma'am.

I am.

I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.

Yes, ma'am.

Aye, ma'am.

What?

I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.

I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.

Yes, ma'am?

Yes?

The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.

I'm breaking no promises!

Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.

Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.

My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.

Excellent!

No, she wasn't.

Dear oh dear.

The same, your Majesty.

Just them?

I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?

Mr Brown is unable to attend today.

I understand he was in a fight.

I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.

Of course, at once.

I have no idea.

From whom?

Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.

He has typhoid fever, ma'am.

Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.

Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.

Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.

I came from the city on the left.

But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...

We are talking...

It's twelve-thirty!

Funny.

How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.

No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.

No way.

We can't...

Nick, what is it.

Like the fractals?

I don't know.

And beat it at it's own game.

I can't believe you made it!

And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!

I already have a boyfriend, Nick.

One.  In case...

Yeah, that's what worries me.

One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?

There never is.

Hold my keys, then.

Yes...

I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...

Yes...but...how did you...

So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.

In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...

It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.

Sign me up.

Can you say anything but "cool"?

I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?

I know.  Where are you Adam?

You're broke!

Sure.

One.

The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.

Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.

I told ya.

Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.

So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.

Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.

Very pleased to meet you.

Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.

I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.

But you won't.

Diane?

I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!

What do you mean?

You don't remember anything else?

Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.

Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.

Come on... let's find you something to wear.

Not that I can see.

Maybe it's not me.

I'm not sure about this.

"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."

I'm all right.

C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.

What ... I..HAVE... to do.

No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.

To get rid of this god-awful feeling.

Two men... two guns in the Caddy.

Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.

Find out who they are?

Interesting.

Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?

Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.

I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....

I don't know.

We have to climb up that.

It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.

Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.

I'm leaving.

Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.

I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.

I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.

I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.

This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.

The Brooklyn Bridge.

Yes.

There's one more person here for me to visit.

It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.

Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?

Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !

I'd get out of the water if I were you.

You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.

Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?

What ?

Got it.

You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !

Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.

Yeah, but we're talking 43.

Checking........

Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?

While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?

What do you mean sir ?

Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.

<<belch>>

Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?

Thank you.

Excuse me, gentlemen

Do you want to go out with me ?

As appealing as that sounds...

Hi. I brought some wine.

Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?

Shut up ! It's me.

What ?

Zach from work ?

I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....

We made it !

Why don't you shut up now.

No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.

Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.

Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?

Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??

I thought I told you to lose this guy.

I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.

You're still asking me to break the law.

What do you remember about her.

You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick

Suspended from school, my mother??

Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....

Okay thanks, atta girl.

Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.

Great.

What boy likes you?

Her favorite poet.

Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!

Totally groovy huh?

Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.

Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.

How about a nice glass of milk?

Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.

I was pushing as fast as I could.

Ummmmm, look, I...I...

I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...

You mean, you knew about me?

Does she?

You are?

Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.

I've got something better.

We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.

Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?

Come on in!

It's okay with me, hi Kevin.

But I wanna write about her.

Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.

I want juice!

No THANKS!

I'd never do that.

Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.

Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?

This isn't just a mood ring.

Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.

What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???

Leave me alone!!

This is a totally barbaric custom.

But we wouldn't really be related right?

This has been a real confusing day.

Some sacrifices are worth it.

Part adventure...part miracle.

You're a good man Nicholas.

Was Rose.

Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?

You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.

Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.

Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.

He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...

Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?

No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.

You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?

You know how I feel about you.

What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.

All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.

Bye Niece, Vada.

Nothing, nothing at all.

Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.

I bet your mom sang to you.

Is there milk in them already?

I don't know, Dad doesn't either.

What do you mean?

But Dad'll never go for it.

Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.

Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.

Good for you baby.

Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.

Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.

WHAT?

Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?

Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.

I think it's still available.

Uhh, Miss devoto...

Deceased.

Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....

I wrote that.

See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.

Want to what?

Goodnight.

Goodnight.

Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?

Okay.

Is it really your camper?

You can get the general idea...

I know that, but what do you want from me?

O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.

Ya, that rack holds six ties.

Then who's it for?

Any more soda left?

Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.

I love this guy! 

Can I go too?

What??

No, no.

Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.

That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.

The last date I had was twenty years ago.

Oh come on.

Are you sure about all this?

Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.

Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!

Thank you. Bye.

I wrote a poem too.

Cool, can I get one for Vada?

Why do you think she says that?

Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.

Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.

Oh.

Can I use your bathroom first?

A girl's always gotta look her best.

Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.

NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.

Vada, Vada, what's the matter?

Goodnight.

They're just fun to read.

Oh no!  UUH.

Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.

What?

Yes.

No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.

What?

I stopped that!

Duck!

My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!

But I have my clothes on!

Hi, wanna ride bikes?

No, I'm hiding out.

Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?

Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.

I honestly wish I could...

I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.

... weeks.

Kindred spirits.

He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...

Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?

I can see why.

I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!

Good girl.

Well, we're...

Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?

Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...

Exactly.

We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.

Don't you see...

... that this is all my fault?

... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.

Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?

He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.

Nobody has.  So far.

Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...

You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!

Well, somet...

Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??

What's next?

Endearingly absent-minded.

Quite the little eccentric.

She finds him "personable."

First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.

What, leaving school...

She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.

You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.

Well, you've got the rest of your lives.

Have you.

It's more than that.

Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.

I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.

The night we met.

We danced to it.  Just like this.

Well.

Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.

"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."

It's over.

I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?

If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...

... yeah, that.

... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.

That is so romantic.

To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?

This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...

Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?

Right here.

Yes. I'm cutting a record.

Is there food?

How did you come in here?

You'll have to speak up.

Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.

Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.

What!

You know better than that.

Yes. She's pretty rested up.

President.

When is it?

Bill, he's a crazy man.

Sue was trying to get hold of you.

The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.

She's in Paris.

Your brother?

Sure he will.

Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.

Yes, ma'am. How are you today?

No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.

Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.

I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.

No.

No.

No.

Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.

Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...

Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.

Does their hair fall out?

I've been a Little dyspeptic.

But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...

Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.

Bye.

Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.

Hi.

I can't.

Oh.

What...?  0h, yes.

Yea.

You sound different. Is that really you?

Hundreds of times.

For him?

You're real favorites of his.

What!

Out.

They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.

Oh?

Did it break?

What?

No, we never did that

Where are you from?

I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?

Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?

You think I should take lessons?

Sure thing.

More or less...

When ya had it, did ya like it?

It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.

Don't stop!

I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.

The prison board and the doctors who examined them.

Using the same doctors is not common practice.

There's a chocolate cream filled in there?

Not good.

Ready.

How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?

Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.

All right, Mickey.

Don't worry about it.

Let's do it.

Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?

You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?

Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.

No. Not really.

Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.

It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.

They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.

Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'

And a snake-eye glare.

They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'

I'll say enough to destroy this wing.

This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.

What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---

So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?

Wayne---

Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.

Wayne Gayle.

How so?

But you'll never be whole again.

See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?

Lose 'em.

One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.

Okay. I'll take two guys off.

I can't do that. Five guys.

I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.

Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?

Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.

No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.

That'll be thirty-eight cents.

Okay.

I don't know what you're talkin' about.

I still don't know what you're talkin' about.

Well, what d'you know?!

Ain't she goin' to take the boy?

Okay.

You must be new in town.

Went to college, huh?

No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?

What d'you expect?

I like a place with lots of life.

Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.

All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?

'Been up north?

That's the way he is.

What d'you mean?

Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.

I didn't know you had one.

Yeah, it's just a coincidence.

Just what I said. Don't look so scared.

Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?

Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.

Yeah?

Smells like something crawled in there and died.

Duff - you know those women you used to know--

Huh?

You jivin' me?

Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?

What d'you mean?

Well, that don't do me one bit of good!

Duff--

How 'bout the key?

Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.

Who're you?

Plannin' on getting married?

Better get him to a hospital.

Whenever he's got an edge on.

I guess I'll rob a bank.

'Musta knocked her up.

Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?

Okay, boy, beat it.

What's the matter now?

Anything you say, baby.

Omar, listen to me--

I'm still on my honeymoon.

I'm fine.

I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?

Of course.

She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.

Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.

He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.

They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.

You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.

Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.

I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.

This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.

Could be your A.I.'s calling card.

Prepping your trip.

Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.

You see the couple up in the balcony?

This ain't Bangkok, chief.

As far as they know, that's absolutely true.

That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?

Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.

I an' I, man. I an' I.

This place empty as a tomb, mon.

I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.

Nobody has.

Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.

Can you take me to it?

The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?

We run. You crack the pattern?

Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?

Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.

It's coming.

Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.

Case.

Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.

There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.

I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.

I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.

What's that supposed to mean?

Almost two days.

A regular Fagan.

Give me five minutes.

Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.

Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.

I'll be okay.

We've still got to find the mainframe.

You're out of time, man.

What are you talking about?

Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.

Right. 7:30.

I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?

Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.

I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--

Jos, that's not what we're --

At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.

I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.

'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.

Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.

It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.

Sometimes opposites attract.

Five-- Six--

You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?

A flack jacket.

But I don't want it straightened out.

Oh. Right.

Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.

There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.

Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.

You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.

She just needs a new windshield wiper.

See!

I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.

Is that true?

wasn't even thinking about-

I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.

Sorry. Forgetful.

Oh I don't think so.

Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.

You remember that story?

To put us back together again when we fall.

What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--

Yeah, I have.

You were attracted to me?

I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!

Why?

It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.

We're very evolved.

I can't help it.

Just what?

Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.

He stayed a long time.

He's conducting experiments of his own.

<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>

What are you talking about?

Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!

Yeah, why?

My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.

You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.

Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...

Look at this car.  Are you kidding?

Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.

Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.

I don't know.  Where are we going?

What's this?

What do you mean?

C'mon, cut it out.

I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.

Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.

I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.

I'm not hungry.

We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.

You okay?

Hi, Kerry.

The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?

Hi Mom.

I thought I'd wait for you.

That's right.  I don't.

They're healing up nicely.

Research.

Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.

YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!

To old friends.

He's real.

I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.

He's too strong!  He was never this strong!

I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...

So?

Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.

I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.

But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.

You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...

We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.

So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.

Sounds like a rough time.

Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.

So do I.

I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.

Try me.

Assuming your mysterious nun in right.

There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.

I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.

And what are they?

What are you talking about?

What?

I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.

You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.

Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.

Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.

I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?

Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."

Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...

Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.

I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?

Now you're lying.

I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.

'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'

Fifteen million dollars.

Fine.

Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.

You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.

Oh -- Okay.

Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.

That's fine.

Step aside.

No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.

No, you were brilliant

Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.

Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.

Well done you.

'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'

What do you think?

I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.

Yes.  Always have had.

Okay.

What?

Don't ask.

How do you think I'm doing?

Thank you.  Shall I...

What's the thing?

Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.

I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?

In a depressingly asexual way.

Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.

What?

Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.

Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.

Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...

Yes?

Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.

Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.

Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.

Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.

But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.

So not over her, in fact.

I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.

How about Miss Flintstone?

Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?

Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.

Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...

Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.

Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.

Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.

Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.

And you get on very well.

I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.

Oh sure.  Of course.

What?

Yes, that's perfectly correct.

Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.

Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...

I-I-I...

Mister McMurphy!

Thank you, ma'am...

Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.

Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.

Sorry, ma'am.

Yes, Mister McMurphy?

No way.

A vote is before the group.

He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!

Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!

Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...

Yes, Miss Ratched...

'K-k-kay, Mack!

W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?

Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...

What? Where?

Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.

What for?

It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.

Yeah, Mack?

Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.

Right, Mack!

Hey, what's that?

Huh?

Through the ass.

Lemme see...

Your buddy is callin' ya.

I'm seeing what a busy man does.

A pecking party?

She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.

Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!

She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.

That's nice. Send me a post card.

I just started!

I don't trust you!

No!

I'm not running a charity ward...

McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...

Hold it a minute.

A nickel.

Yeah, it's cold!

Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.

Arrested on an assault charge five times...

Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?

We'll let you know.

What's the horse pill for, honey?

Yeah, what's up?

Prayin', brother. Prayin'.

Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...

You an' me, Chief.

Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?

Hi.

On what?

Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!

I don't have any.

Tha's your problem.

Now you talkin'.

No way...

Why, sure, ma'am...

Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.

Yes, ma'am...

What's that?

He's dead.

Oh, yeah...

No, she wasn't my sister.

Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.

Buona notte.

Your hair... is perfect.

You're sure...

She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.

Exactly.

Except possibly that.

No.

But, Faith--

But Faith--

No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.

Hm.

Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.

I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?

You said whatever it was you would understand.

I'm in love with you.

I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.

Yes.

Well, good.  Good for you.

Hi.  Are you... busy?

Well.  Congratulations.

You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--

Yes.

Yeah.  He's around somewhere.

No.  He smokes.

Is he gay?

I don't know, Kate.

Yes you did.

Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.

I know.  You're right.

What about your job?

Does Dwayne know about this?

You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?

How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--

Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.

Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.

He fell out.

Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?

The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?

What'd you find?

What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?

You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.

Her brother.

I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--

Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?

Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.

Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?

Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.

The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.

What?

Yes.  Isn't that amazing?

My God... you're right.

No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.

Yup.

A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.

Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.

You don't have to go if you don't want to...

Giovanni.

No, why?

It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.

You used to love it when I called you doll.

Went to high school with him. But...

He missed me.

She didn't give me a chance.

Mania.

He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.

So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this a deal I sweated and bled for on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?

Why should he forget it?

In a minute.

Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.

But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.

You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.

They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.

Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.

I know. I know.

Okay I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.

Why Edie, I

I wish I knew, Edie, But 

Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.

I'll get home all right now.

Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.

Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in

The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?

Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into meI foxed 'em.

Do you like pigeons?

I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.

Oh she's a beauty.

Even pigeons aren't peaceful.

I am?

Naw, in the ring, a dive is-

I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killednever mind how. Charley and I was put in a placethey called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?

Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?

All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.

I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .

It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .

Why should I come hollering to you at all?

I can't let myself fall in love with you.

There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.

What I did to Joey.

Edie it's

Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.

How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.

Get away from me.

I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened I'm frightened.

Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.

Get out of my way.

I thought you might want some hot coffee.

Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.

He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .

Someone else c'n take your confession.

You go to hell.

I can? Okay.  Okay...

Are you on the level, Father?

If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?

Baseball bats that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.

You know what you're askin'? You're askin'

Wilson yeah  yeah I fought Wilson.

Such as what?

Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher hooks over 'n under   whop-whop!

Be sure they got enough water.

Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.

Looking for me?

But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?

No.

Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 

So-so, Johnny.

Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I

It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.

Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.

Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.

Then..then what's that music?

I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.

I should hope not.  I hate you!

Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.

What can we do against them?

A situation easily remedied.

It would seem so, Master

The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...

Ahh, she will be yours.

Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?

Well then let us proceed.

You know better than that.

Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.

Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.

I'm so frightened.

Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?

And the one driving the other car?

From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.

No, thanks.

He didn't want me to.

Really.  Hm.

Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.

Why you want to do that, to a frien'?

Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.

How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?

Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.

He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.

Shit.

Uh-huh...

Love is funny.

Yeah, and I better call my sister.

I saw Karen Sisco.

I don't know.

Half for doing what?

I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.

They sure do.

They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.

And then they'll kill 'em.

Jack --

Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?

But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.

What?  Is that what you're calling me about?

You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.

I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.

How are you, Raymond?

Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.

Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.

No, I didn't know that.

I'll need a last known address.

It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?

Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.

We're leaving.

I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.

Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.

Of course I am.

Bleeding on a country road.

You have to be kidding.

With Robert Redford, when he was young.

Uh-huh.  Well, but if --

How do we do that?

You won't do that.

I just thought maybe you and me could--

Those guys bother you?

I called your room from downstairs.

So do you.

She did, huh.

I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.

Where?

My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.

You're in civilization now, man, ease up.

How many?

Okay.  How many going out?

You know who they are?

Oh, uh, right, thanks...

No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.

The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.

How are you, Richard?

Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.

The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.

Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.

Like what?

Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.

I remember you now.  Shit.

We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--

Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.

Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.

He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.

I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.

Gimme another hint.

Oh...

How you know that?

Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.

Thanks.

You a lawyer?

Then they're not separated, are they?

What'd I say?

Huh.

No?

I see that.

I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.

I didn't have time.

So?

He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?

I don't have any idea.

The combination is three-ten-forty-four.

Yeah, as soon as we got back.

Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.

Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.

Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.

Jack Foley, famous bank robber.

No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.

Red...Strange?

Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.

Yes Sir.

You liked that?

Hale-what?

A m-missionary?

He did.

Home of the brave!

The Colonel helped me work it out.

Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.

It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.

Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.

You left her.  How's that for a fact?

Come on!

Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.

Six P-40's.

Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.

Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.

Home of the brave.

I'm out of fuel!

What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?

Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?

No.  You're trying to beat me.

They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.

He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.

I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?

He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.

We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.

I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.

How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?

Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."

No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.

We're all going away.

I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.

How did you?...

I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?

If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.

The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.

And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.

The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.

Peggy Sue!

I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?

I'm not telling.

That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.

Stag movies. Smokers.

How do you like my hair?

Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.

Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?

I can't. It's all too much.

Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.

Aren't we a little old for that?

After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.

What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.

You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.

Don't say that...

Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.

Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.

Charlie! Am I dead?

Oh yeah?

They'll learn to live with it.

Would you?

Thanks.

But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.

Who?

You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.

Save it.

Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?

What am I going to do with you?

I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.

Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.

I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.

Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.

Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.

I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.

You're going to listen to me.

How could you possibly know what I've been going through?

Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?

I'm trying.

What about Janet?

Test?

What, why?

I wish she hadn't.

Come on, where's your enthusiasm?

He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.

Don't you get along with your parents?

I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.

Is that one of your poems?

For everyone.

What a treat.

Just a little. I've had a tough day.

Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.

I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.

Open it.

Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.

It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.

That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.

This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?

Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.

I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.

We'll make it, we'll be fine.

Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.

Oh. I forgot.

I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.

It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.

She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?

I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.

What do you mean?

I don't feel very festive.

Way to go, Mom!

Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?

I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.

But accidents can happen.

Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.

You're a sweet man, Richard.

I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.

So you think time travel is possible? For people?

I don't know.

Am I dead or not?

Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.

I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 

I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.

Wbat're you talking about?

That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?

Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?

Wait! I'll go with you!

Well... uh... thanks...

--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?

He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...

It's been a few years.

Sure.

It sucked.

You alright?

Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.

"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...

I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...

Zowie.

He was dead. You know he was.

What do you mean?

I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...

Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.

Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...

I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.

Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?

What's that on your forehead, pal?

I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.

Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!

Ready for what, baby?

Honesty is always best.

Don't do this, Andy.

Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...

One week old.

Little baby girl.

Continue.

Continue.

Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.

What?

Let's find you a drink.

Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.

Correct.

Do you... pray?

What have you prayed for?

I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...

What impressed you about him?

No. I didn't.

Something like that.

No.

That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.

One. Here, in front of my ear.

I'm fine.

All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.

Yes.

Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.

Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.

Thank you. No more questions.

I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?

Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?

It satisfied me.

In a word, yes.

Give me the camera, Joe.

Okay, Joe...

Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!

Night, honey.

Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?

Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.

Any women on board?

I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.

Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.

Lookit. Lookit!

It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!

Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?

<u>What</u>?

Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.

Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.

Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.

Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.

Saw something I didn't like.

Let's drop back an' boot up.

I can't....I can't....

But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.

200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."

Tell me it's not a mirage.

Shut up.

Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....

Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.

<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.

25 kilos each, huh?

60 years ago.

He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.

-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.

He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.

Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --

We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.

For your own fear.

I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.

-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --

-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.

He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --

You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.

So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?

Company's not here, is it?

Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.

Quiet, please. Everyone.

And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?

And what about the cells?

Rain.

I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --

I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.

Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.

We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.

Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.

Not afraid of the dark, are you?

Said "looks clear."

Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?

No. She's not.

Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.

Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?

You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?

Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.

That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.

Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?

It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.

No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.

Right now, if you like.

Good luck then.

Remembers what?

And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?

I don't. And I'm not going to try.

That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.

No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.

Zira....

None at all.

That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.

The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.

Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?

Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.

Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.

Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.

I admit, I know nothing of your culture.

Show this to the President.

Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.

You don't seem very cut up about it.

long pause) You know it.

Let's take a look.

You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.

In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.

Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.

What is it?

What?

The Hunt Club.

Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!

Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.

I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.

I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.

All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.

That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.

Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.

Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.

Listen, listen -- I can speak --

A hearing.

No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.

Maybe not.

Taylor, you can't.

Of course. He saw you moving yours.

Yes, Sir.

He doesn't know.

He's dead! Where?... You saw him?

Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.

Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.

Yeah, what is it?

I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 

De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.

Yeah if you let me have your shirt.

Youse so fucked up man.

What?

You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.

Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.

Then what do you suggest big shot?

Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.

Out there man - behind the log.

Yeah.

Dawn...

In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...

No... I move faster alone. 

Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway.  Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man.

Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...

Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...

Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.

Found it. Growing in a garden.

That's what he is... Baaaa!

Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...

I don't want to hear about it Jackson.

My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.

I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.

Thank you.

Not tonight.

Why certainly, baby.

How careful should I be?

How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?

Immigration Officer?

I see.

What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.

I don't.

You didn't have to tell him that.

Quarter after one. Why?

Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.

Just who are you, anyway?

So have I.

I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--

That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?

They'll look for you.

And Betty Mayfield--

He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.

So that I will never be found.

But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.

Beer?  Well, all right.

You understand perfectly.

Points very straight to her.

They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.

Goodbye, Betty.

I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.

This way.

You asked for it.

Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.

For five hundred, what do I get?

For two hundred?

Why not here?

Leave that one lay.

Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?

The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.

A private joke.

She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.

On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.

If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?

I never notice the view after the first week.

Would that make me a heel?

Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?

Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.

You don't throw guests out, Brandon.

Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.

I don't think you locked your door.

Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.

How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.

Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.

Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.

How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.

So the shell ought to have gone over?

I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.

Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.

Maybe we've been pretty dumb--

Should be over there.

Pretty big chance, huh?

So?

He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.

And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.

Oh nothing.

Mortar shells are not funny, either.

You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.

Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.

A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.

I don't know, sir.

Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.

Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.

Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.

Who's the girl?

Nice.

You ought to know why.

Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.

I say YES!

Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...

What a shame.

Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--

Yes.

Thanks.

Yes.

We'll see you next week, and if--

Yes.

Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?

Very good.

Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?

I'm not sure I can face it.

It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.

Hello.

Thank you.

And to history.

I think it went on rather too long.

And I didn't like that man.

I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.

Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.

I think she liked me.

No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.

I haven't really thought about it.

I might.

Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.

I know.  I'm sorry.

We were just chortling over that. Blasé and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.

We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.

Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"

On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--

Yes, finally.

Are you up to something?

My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.

She said that?

Now listen...

And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?

In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.

Oh no!

It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.

The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.

No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.

News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.

Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--

Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!

After you, Alfonse.  I insist!

Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.

See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.

Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?

SHIT!!

Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.

1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.

Babes.

Caught my first tube this morning.

Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.

The fucking punks are surfers.

Thanks, buddy.

Okay, Dad.

Did he rob it?

Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.

I need you to teach me.

Catch of the day.

We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.

Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!

Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!

Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.

What about the rest of Hopper's men?

Like the old days, Dillon.

They're getting better equipped every day.

Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.

No more games.

It's been a long time, General.

That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.

Hawkins?

Philip!  We'll need shoes!

Twenty-five percent.

I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.

I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.

<u>Expected</u>... offer.

Yes.

No.

Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.

I never joke about money.

What?

Off the boulevard.

Can I have some chips?

Right.  So!  In town on business?

I've known a lot of everybody.

Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.

Just a romantic, that's you.

If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.

Mmm, I could tell.

"Occupational hazard".

There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.

Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.

Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?

I thought I told you not to answer the phone.

Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.

I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.

Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.

I think it's exciting.

He's good at what he does.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Shush.  Of course you can.

I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.

It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.

Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.

Thank you.

Afternoon.

Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.

Oh, god, what?

We're letting them slide?

The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.

Yes...

Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.

So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.

Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.

I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.

I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?

Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.

Where do you fit?

And leave all this?  Not in a million.

Kit give me nothin'.

What?

Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?

Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?

Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.

I like steak.

I was in here yesterday.

I think it's great.

Should I be?

I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.

And what am I?

Of course you will.

This is true love. You think this happens every day?

But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?

What? -- go on --

Gently.

You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?

I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.

Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.

It's you.

-- where?

What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.

We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.

That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.

-- murdered by pirates is good --

Do you want me to go on with this?

I don't understand.

No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.

Okay.

My spy network has heard no such news.

I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.

Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --

Of course.

Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.

I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.

True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.

In that case --

-- offer me money --

I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!

Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?

Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?

Thank you.

Nothing comes to mind.

Again. Thank you.

Then why are you smiling?

Get used to disappointment.

Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.

Inconceivable!

You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.

Oh, have it your way.

You've made your decision then7

Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.

It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.

I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.

A good hour. Yeah.

It would take a miracle. Bye!

Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?

Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.

I have hurt your feelings.

I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.

I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?

You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.

You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.

Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!

Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!

It's a little better, but you still look angry.

Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?

You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!

I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!

Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.

Leo, what if this play is a hit?

They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."

The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.

Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.

What???

He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 

Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.

We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.

Really, I never dreamed ...

We swear it!

It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.

I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.

You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?

Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?

Nice girl.

Call chauffeur.  Get car.

You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.

Here I come, ready or not.

Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.

And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.

I shall count the minutes.

Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.

Of Siegfried...

Nietzche...

And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.

Vat?

Where are you going vit the light?

No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!

Send for Goebbels.

I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.

Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.

Or arrived with her.

You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?

How do you know she didn't make a call?

You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...

I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.

If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?

Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...

Not even a hunch. Just hope.

I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...

Of course not. Please.

Five hundred.

I'd like to be ready when he gets back.

You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!

Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.

Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!

Don't you know?

You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.

Yes.

Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!

Where could he have gone?

Who's he?

Well?

All right! Then call! At least, call!

Watch your tenses.

You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!

I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?

The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!

What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?

Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.

I've lost my girlish laughter.

I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.

We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!

Sam! No!

I'm thinking of it.

Don't miss your plane.

I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.

You have a vacancy?

The bathroom.

Thank you. Again.

I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.

Oh I do... but I say I don't. 

Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.

I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.

I'd like to, but...

Crane.

Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...

I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?

Then I'm free to go...?

Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...

Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...

Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.

Maybe you saw Mary!

Shut up!

Leave me alone!

Mother, please...

Left Phoenix under her own steam?

Did she talk?

I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?

Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.

Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.

You found Buckley?

Well, news of Buckley?

Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.

It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.

I'm losing my blood!

Yes!

Yes.

But ... the dogs...

No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.

You would.

I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.

Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.

She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.

What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.

It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.

We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.

Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.

Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.

That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.

That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 

Well, I won't work on it from that angle.

Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.

We'll grant that.

Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.

They don't suspect <I>him</I>?

Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.

Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?

Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...

No, really -- I'm crazy about you.

You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?

I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.

But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.

Yes.

You taking any medication?

Dad...

Where to?

That's the physicist's playground.

That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --

So I can move on.  You too.

But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.

He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.

There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.

Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.

But Rose...

Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.

He did?

Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.

I don't want to know...

What are you going to do, Rose?

They're dumb things. I got tired of them.

Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.

What was your mother like?

Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.

Well, yeah.

This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.

What did you say, Brother?

She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.

They're discussing it.

Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?

What are they doing?

Buddy, that was my place.

Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.

Doll, don't ask childish questions.

Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.

That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.

Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.

No, son, she is dead.

It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,

Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?

Oh. Did you say something?

And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.

There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.

Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.

No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.

You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.

Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!

Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.

She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.

But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?

What did you forget?

Over... my... dead... body!

Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...

No, sir.

Oh, anywhere downtown.

I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.

I will see you at suppertime, Rose.

Tennessee?

No, you're not.

What was it, Mr. Hillyer?

It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?

Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.

Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.

Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?

Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.

Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?

You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.

She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.

I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?

Let me be the judge of that, Madam.

No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.

Illusions, Madam?

More history, Rose.

Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!

It'll get better now.

I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.

I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.

Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.

I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.

Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.

Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...

Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.

Fair enough.

I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.

Again.

Thank you, concerned citizen.

I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.

Relax.

I'm just saying...

You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...

Yeah.

Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.

Clench your teeth.

Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping Capital of the World.

Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.

Name one.

Wha... ?

What... what kinda thing is that to say?

I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.

We have to find Kittle.

Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.

Can't you say something nice once?

If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.

You're lying...

I'm waiting till the time's right.

Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.

We've got the tape to prove it.

You going rogue on me?

You can't be serious.

Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.

What?

You're about an inch away from insubordination!

You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?

I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.

Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.

Don't crowd him.

He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.

I know it is, even if you don't.

Gimmie a minute.

You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?

Keep 'em busy.

Yeah.

It's one of a kind.

We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.

You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.

I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.

Leia! Leia's my sister.

She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!

Where am I?

Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.

How are we doing?

Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.

All set.

Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.

I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.

We got separated.

That's all any of us can see.

It'll work. It'll work.

It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.

I don't know.

No, wait! I thought you were blind!

All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!

Good, I hate long waits.

On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?

All right, hang on.

Come on! Come on!

Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.

Red Leader standing by.

All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.

She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?

Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?

But, why must you confront him?

You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.

I will not fight you.

Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.

I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...

Certainly not!

I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?

Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.

Made me give you the eye And then panic,

I've got something to say.

I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.

For you.

Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.

Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?

We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.

It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.

No, don't do that.

Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?

Yes.

Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.

Cross my heart and hope to die.

From Transexual Transylvania.

Now I

That ain't no crime

No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.

My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'

...I suppose.

...I suppose.

Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?

I wanna let my brother know where I am.

Yes, I do.

Yes.

Do me another favor?

Don't tease me.

I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?

Don't want weak legs.

Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.

What're we going to do?

Paulie!

I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!

...I don't feel heat from the name.

People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.

Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!

...Still don't feel no heat.

He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.

The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.

Does that bum have to say that?

Buy us some Thunderbird, man.

Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.

Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.

...Ten minutes.

It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?

This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.

I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'

Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.

I agree.

The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --

Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.

Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!

I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.

Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?

Yeah.

Rocky.

...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.

Maybe I like garbage.

What?

Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?

Spider Rice.

Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.

Freak luck is a strange thing.

Turtles -- domestic turtles.

Rocky, d'ya know what I done?

Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.

...I'm doin' it for a friend.

I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.

Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.

See what?

Bullmastiff.

Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.

I'm thirty myself.

Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.

Try again, c'mon, try again.

Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.

Gazzo's a good man.

What?

...People talk to me more.

Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?

You serve martinis, doncha?

Well, I'll be...

C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?

Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?

Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?

I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.

He's a Toon... who cares?

Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?

<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.

What the hell would they want with a gag factory?

Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.

Toon cops worked me over.

Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.

That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.

The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.

So's the job.

Valiant?  What're you doin' here?

I've already seen your photographs.

Have you got the will?

Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.

But, Eddie, you know what happens when...

Me.

What is this, Twenty Questions?

Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?

A Toon?  Noooo.

That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.

And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?

If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.

Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.

Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

Why, what is Tybalt?

Am I like Such a fellow?

Good-morrow, cousin.

Of love?

In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.

Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him

I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.

My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.

If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!

Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.

Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!

Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.

Madam, in happy time what day is that?

Madam, I am here. What is your will?

I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!

Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?

Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife

Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.

Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

Ahhh!

With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

Well what shall I swear by?

If my heart's dear love--

A thousand times good night! Exit, above

I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.

I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.

Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.

That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.

Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.

OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.

I am for you.

Is she a Capulet?

Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all

Do you really think so?

When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.

Best beer in the world known to man or God.

It's been known to happen.

Not yet...

Don't even think that I'm buying that.

Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.

I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.

There's a problem...

I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.

You first, Edvard.

He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!

I take it you still want the money...

Enough!

It is, I'm telling you it is!!

But you hate each other!

I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...

Now that is an interesting proposition.

A post office box.

What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.

There is one other thing...

Don't cross me...

Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?

You should really let a doctor look at that.

Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?

Call it a reckoning of character.

Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?

Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.

One's a lot more painful than the other.

I wonder if she truly left the IRA.

I wanted to see who you were.

You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.

Know what?

Gregor's cell phone...

Not exactly.

If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.

Yes.

Dark ops?

Because I owe you.  Look at that...

What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.

Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.

You sure?

I hear you.

We'll figure something out.

What's that?

What are you gonna do?

He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!

That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.

He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!

Okay then.  I'll do it.

No.

We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.

It's NOT too late!

What's your offer, Jesse?

You better believe it if you know what's good for you!

Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.

Oh.  You coming by tonight?

I'm in here.

Nothing happened?

He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.

I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.

I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.

Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.

Could it have been this?

A week ago, at most.

What?

Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?

Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --

What are you getting at?

Maybe I should come along.

Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.

Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.

No, I can't say that I have.

No I don't.  You sure you havent seen her?

Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.

All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?

Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.

I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.

Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.

Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?

Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.

Then what the hell are you all about?

And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?

Well you're not getting, either.

I was in the neighborhood.

At least around here it does.

Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.

Yeah.  Figured you could have it.

Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.

Give me the bad news.

Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.

No, sir.

El Capitan?

We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.

I said get on your feet!

I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!

It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.

No.  It's my first time.

Oh yes, she's very nice.

You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.

That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.

This won't take long.

This is a very dangerous man.

I'm calling for back up!

Don't look at my ass!

Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.

Who?

Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.

I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.

Good at what?

Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.

Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.

What's going on?

Gimme the binoculars.

Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.

She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.

It's your turn!

It's a bomb.

We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.

Why did you help me?

We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.

You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.

Fine by me.

They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.

Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.

That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.

Follow me my Asian brother.

She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.

This money is evidence.

The Plaza Hotel?

Amen to that, brother.

Just trying to make it look real.

I'm fine.

The Secret Service?  Why?

Put the plates down.  It's over.

I know, Master, but...

Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --

In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.

Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.

Stooly.

Thank you. I learn a great deal.

Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.

Yeah, it's good.

No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.

This concrete?  This is still America.

I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.

It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.

What?

Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.

You know him?

No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?

Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.

Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.

What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.

Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.

You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.

Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.

You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!

Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?

Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.

You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.

It's Griffin.

Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.

Ike just came by to check out the team.

Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.

Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."

I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.

How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?

What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?

Good one!  Thanks.

God bless you, Maggie.

"Make the shot."

Look, he's in pretty good shape.

What are you trying to say to me, Fish?

Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.

But I'll get my normal fee, right?

Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?

Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.

Are you a reporter?

Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.

Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.

-- The luau for Maggie.

We'll see.

Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.

Twice...

Without oxygen...

How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.

Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.

Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.

He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.

Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?

Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?

Of course.

It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.

Missed me bad, huh?

Or the sexual habits of locusts?

I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.

Me?

I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.

They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.

"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".

Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!

For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?

Where?

Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?

No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.

No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.

No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".

No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.

"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.

-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --

He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --

Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.

What?

It was my mother's.

So what happened?

At the top of the Empire State Building --

I think that's what I'm saying.

About what?

That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.

Actually, he sounded nice.

Listen to this, I love this part --

I always wondered about that too.

I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?

I saw her.  She looked just like this --

That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?

Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?

I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.

Yes, I did.

I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?

Mom!

Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?

It's me?

Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.

I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.

It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.

How about rapacious and love- starved?

I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.

Yeah.  What's that?

What is it?

Nobody else is going to know it was us.

Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.

I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --

Dad, you're not taking this seriously.

-- a slice of pizza --

What do you think?

Whose show was this on?

Good.

I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 

The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.

It might be in the kitchen.

Shut up.

I was scared of what you were gonna do.

Okay.

Sure.

Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --

Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?

Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.

You could have called me --

So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.

There's nothing stopping you.

It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.

It never ends.

What do you mean -- sex equality?

No, Estellita.

Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.

No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...

Don't you worry. We'll get some action.

I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.

Never... never... never!

It's nothing. Just a little catch ...

He was born fighting. And born hungry.

He'll have it good. Some day.

They say I am no good to you.

What makes you so sure?

Over my dead body.

No.

There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.

I've had them since the day they were born.

You weren't waiting for me.

Hunting.

Why not? I'm not needed here.

Will you be still?

Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.

Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?

Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?

You've got to help around the house!

He's a guest in my house, isn't he?

No.

The spiders.

Come on.  Ease off the girl.

Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 

Did you see his hair color?

I understand. Thanks anyway.

I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.

Ouch.

Colette ...

Why not?

Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.

Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.

Like you?

I try.

I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?

Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?

Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?

Please open the door, Danny.

Find a new job.

Look, maybe you oughta' leave.

I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.

Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.

Danny, it's not what you think.

I don't want to leave you.

What?

I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.

Guess it's our turn.

I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?

Can your man handle that?

The Del Ammo Mall mostly.

Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.

Palmdale

John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

Yes, Jimmy.

You aren't coming with me.

Wait till I tell you what it is.

You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.

It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?

When? When did you ever see me use?

You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?

Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.

I'm sorry. I couldn't.

You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.

Hey, I was just trying to ...

Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.

God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.

I'm afraid so, Danny.

Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.

My name is Tom.

It speaks!

To who?

Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?

They have. But they never found a lab.

Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.

There's no motels around here.

I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.

Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.

Now that's scary!

Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.

It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.

He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.

The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.

Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.

Looks like a flaming asshole to me.

I guess.

Good, now get your goddamned gear.

Say what, Cap'n?

That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.

Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.

You know classical music?

I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.

I don't expect to live that long.

Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.

Plenty.

Okay, Wade.  Translators?

That's not what we're here for.

It doesn't take this.

You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.

How about you shut up and take your position?

Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.

Yeah.

Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.

Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.

Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.

Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.

Sure, Reiben.

Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?

We can't leave it here.

I thought you said we had an hour, sir?

Have it your way, Captain.

Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.

That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?

Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.

I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.

Upham and Jackson, what were they like?

As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.

Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.

...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.

What are we likely to run into?

It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...

Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.

We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.

So you refuse to answer my questions?

Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.

Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?

He's a mess!

I'm gonna call her.

Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.

Lloyd.

See you tomorrow.

Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.

Come on, it's graduation.

I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.

He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.

Look at his face, he did the deed.

What?  I'm sorry, talk.

I just saw Joe.  He's here.

I can accept that.

He'd like to start serving immediately.

Look, why don't you just call Diane again?

Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!

Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!

Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.

You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.

Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.

I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.

I was irresponsible, I should have called.

Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.

I'm fine.

Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.

You're going.

Bon voyage.

'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...

Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.

Just finishing up in here.

Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?

But I found the money.

What am I supposed to think?

I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.

Alright.

Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.

Well, not monumentally.

Pardon me?

Eight.

No.

Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.

No.

It's the worst job since keymaster.

Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.

Sixteen weeks is a long time.

Okay.

I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?

Yeah.

It was wonderful.

We decided...

No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...

No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.

My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.

I love you.

Okay, good, this is all very noble.

Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.

Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.

He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?

Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.

Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.

How do you pay for one of those?

I'm totally and completely serious.

You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.

I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.

It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.

Hey.

I'm Lloyd Dobler.

Alright.  Key?

You know Diane Court?

Thanks a lot Lloyd.

You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!

Klaus Tauber.

My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.

War.

It's a beautiful city.

In Breslau.

True.

These people, my people, I want my people.

I just told you.

I asked for metal, you gave me glass.

You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.

There's nothing in the stores.

I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.

Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.

I need a drink.

Pistols?

He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?

I think most people right now have other priorities.

Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.

The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.

Oskar -

Are you losing money?

There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.

More.

They're withholding payment.

No, no, what, what is it?

Attic, garage, basement, nothing.

They've broken their pattern.

On national television.

That's smart.

What? I can't hear you...

Who is this?

That's okay.

What if I said you?

I'll go. I don't mind. Really.

You could start with an apology.

Its over, Cotton.

Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.

And much richer as a result.

I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.

No, I don't.

Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.

Youre all in this together?

Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.

Enter Cotton Weary.

Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...

Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.

Sid, you don't have to.

I'll get my jacket.

No. This is a set up.

Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?

Until now.

Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu things been done.

And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.

I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.

I know that.

Can we turn the light on?

Let's find out.

He filmed his victims.

Yeah, right.

Whatever.

That's not the way we play the game.

Watch your back.

Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.

My morn was a Delta.

I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.

Is Sid in therapy?

Don't do this.

I'd really just like to be alone.

The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.

Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.

The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.

Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?

..we only promote safe rubbered sex.

Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.

Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.

I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.

Melinda McGraw?

I don't know.

Do I?

I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.

Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?

It may be Maureen Reynolds --

I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.

There's more.

I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.

But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!

Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.

You mean like, movie trilogies?

To me Hollywood is about death.

I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.

Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.

Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.

Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.

She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.

You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.

Fuck!

Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!

Do you want us to come with you?

Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.

Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?

Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?

No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!

And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.

Need to get in that building?

Gale Weathers would find a way. 

What are you talking about?

Let's get out of here!

Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?

Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.

What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!

Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?

SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".

Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.

W-what do you want?

Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.

I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!

Are you sure?

Who the fuck is this?

And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.

Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.

I'm sorry. Don't hate me.

I'll only stay a sec.

So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.

Then what is it? Is there somebody else?

When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.

You have to move on, Sid.

What?

Fuck you.

Stop it!

Are you alone in the house?

Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?

To apologize.

Guess.

Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?

So, you gotta boyfriend?

Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?

NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?

More of a game, really.

They'd never make it in time.

Sure...

Guess.

No...

I can't think.

NOOOO....

Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.

Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?

Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.

No, not yet.

Deputy... good evening.

I don't think you're so bad.

Sidney's father?

Yes, you doofus.

Hold up a sec...

You're sure it was the Hilton?

We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.

How is she?

We haven't located her Dad yet.

Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?

You think he could still be in town?

Yes, sir.

Call the police.

I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.

You want to go live?

But it's so much easier when we make it up.

What's the delay?

Kenny. Camera. Now.

What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.

Has his story changed?

He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.

Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.

And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.

Uh-huh.

LEAVEMEALONE!

Who are you?

Got it.

Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.

Twice.

Don't shoot. It's me.

You got it.

Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.

Before she dumped him for Steve.

I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.

We had a run in the mass murder section.

Wanna another beer?

Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.

Yeah, okay... whatever.

No way.

Do they know who did it?

How do you gut someone?

Yeah, yeah... are you okay?

Later.

It's past seven.

Billy and his penis don't deserve you.

Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.

Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."

That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.

Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.

There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.

You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.

I thought you might want to be filled in.

We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.

It would be too hard.

Why?

David... please...

Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...

I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?

I realize that.

And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.

What?

Guessing at this point is useless.

I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.

This was one sadistic motherfucker.

This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.

Whoa, whoa... what?!

What about sports?

I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.

I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.

Punishing.

Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.

Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.

He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.

I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.

I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.

No kidding!  No fucking kidding!

Yes we do.  Here...

Him?

The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.

We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.

We need a warrant.

I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.

Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.

You do your job...

People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.

It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.

Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.

I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.

Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.

Kiss me on the lips.

No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.

I guess I won't be showing it to him then.

Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.

He mentioned it.

I hate this city.

What, Ben?

Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.

It was, I tell you!

No sir...pleasure.

He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.

Just keep goin'...

That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...

This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?

Now mount up, son...

Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...

God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...

Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.

But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...

Grab hold!...

Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?

Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...

In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.

Well...I know there were some captives recovered...

You've done a lot of growin'...

Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.

Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.

No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.

An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.

YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!

I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...

Because she's my...my...

Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...

Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...

How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!

Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....

It's what I'm countin' on.

You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!

I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!

You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...

<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!

You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...

Oh God, Tommi...

You'll never get away from me!

You?

Making our very own solstice fire.

No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?

Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.

An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?

Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!

What are you talking about-

...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.

You don't remember?

It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?

I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.

I've killed my husband!

We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.

The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.

It's good.

Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.

Yes.

Twenty pounds on delivery

The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.

No Juliet?!

A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.

And yet you tell me you lie with women?

She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so

yet cannot love nor write it.

Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.

Oh, that.

Yes, but very well.

Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.

Who are you?

It is all locked safe in here

Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.

Go on.

How will it?

Burbage says you have a play.

I liked the dog, for laughs.

Your Majesty.

And I love poetry above all.

Oh, but they can!

Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.

"Madam!"

"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"

I like her.

I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.

If they find you here they will kill you.

Can you love a player?

Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?

Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.

There is.

I must. Look-- how pale the window.

Yes, some of it is speakable.

Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.

Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.

My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.

"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."

Sold in marriage and half way to America.

How does it?

So my lord? I speak with him every day.

Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.

You flatter, my lord.

Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?

Do you understand me?

Of course you have not! I have not written it!

If you love her, you must do what she asks.

It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.

By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?

On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps

A theatre poet?

Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.

You are on my ground.

I don't know -- Campbell or something?

Serve.

All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.

He couldn't get his car started.

You call them if you want.

A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.

Dig the pit, I don't know.

We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?

I don't hear this.

Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.

Is this necessary?

Just stop worrying.

Looking for you? Yes.

I beg your pardon?

Yeah, I was phoning your mother.

About the mail --

Yes.

Oh, yes, it's great.

Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?

Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.

For the flat.

She hated you --

What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'

That's not him.

Are you all right?

Don't you?

Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --

And the money?

Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.

It's the only way.

Alex.

Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?

That's what I thought he said.

Well, if you do, you'll let us know?

No, three. Who said there were four?

Someone lost the key.

Do you smoke?

Did you ever kill a man?

Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.

Two hundred pounds?

With a face like this?

It was on the television.

You and me?

And you need your sleep.

That one, last week.

The telephone? It continues to ring.

No. But he needs treatment.

That sounds fine.

I mean, that's what it's like.

Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.

I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.

Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?

Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.

Maybe... why do you ask?

That's okay too.

No.

My keys.

Listen, baby, don't leave, really.

These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.

I don't want to see you anymore.

I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!

Whatever you say.

What about?

I hope she's all right.

I mean it or I wouldn't say it.

Nobody can hear it.

Uh-uh.

Let it ring.

No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.

I guess so.

I guess so.

Yeah.

I never get my hair done.

Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?

I guess not...

Oh fuck, Norman!

He's a very private person, actually.

Probably the bathroom.

No, I'm sure.

What are you talking about?

-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?

He never stopped.

-- look, you don't have to entertain me...

Mmmm --

Look who's talking.

-- do you want ice?

That's it, then I'm leaving.

What?

She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.

-- oh -- sweetheart...

I don't have your number, stop by the shop.

No shit?

George, I don't --

What?

Honey, what happened?

We live together now.

-- Sure.

Hey, baby, what's happening?

Great.

Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.

Going where?

Honey, have they offered you the job?

Just a second, I'll be right with you...

Neither do I, baby.

Who?

Look at the way I live.

-- she's a very compulsive girl.

I'm very tired, George.

I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.

I'm better than the guy I work for.

I know what you mean.

Well... who are those guys?

What can I say!

I'm not anti-Establishment.

Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?

Okay, thanks.

What about her?

I... uh... I... uh... can't.

No.

Okay.

Who do you think I was talking to?

Then you were talking to him.

So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!

Really? How about starting with tonight?

What's that?

Fine.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Aren't you going to have one?

I don't know. Why don't you ask him?

Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.

I have to meet a client... who're you dating?

I'll call you.

Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.

I know, I'm sorry.

-- No. No really.

But you have problems?

Well yes -- you know that about George.

Honey?

-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?

My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.

-- never mind.

He's a hairdresser.

Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.

-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...

Jill.

Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.

No.

-- we're going to be here all night.

Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.

Where to, Les?

Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.

I guess so.

French Fries and Ketchup.

Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.

I'm not supposed to.

Do they know he tell you things?

Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.

Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.

Okay.  You behave yourself.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Not right now, Daddy's asleep.

Okay, Mom.

Red Rum.  Red Rum.

Danny, come here!

Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'

Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.

Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?

Ah he dislocated his shoulder.

Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?

Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.

Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.

There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.

Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.

Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,

Good.

It's good to be back, Lloyd.

Hi, hon.  How's it going?

God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?

I think he did it to himself.

When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?

Of course you are.

Oh Jack, what are you talking about?

Wendy!

Give me the bat.

Give me the bat.

Go away.

Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.

I'm intrigued.

shut in together over long periods of time.

put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.

Oh!

Oh, I'll say.

Blue. This blue.

For getting a divorce?

Yeah.

I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.

Do I need one?

It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.

A tracer. You'll like it.

I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.

I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-

I told you!

I told you!

Marty, the moon wasn't even full!

The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.

But Uncle Al! You said-

-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!

If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.

Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.

BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH

'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.

Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.

Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?

You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?

You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?

Yes, Betty?

Oh my! 

Just about.  Show me again.

No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.

The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE

Am I?

That man -- who is he?

This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.

It's true -- I know her.

What a shame!

Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.

Mary Robert.

Amateurs 2

Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.

Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.

Excuse me?

Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.

Experience!

I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.

Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.

Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?

She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.

Don't you know it!

What did He say?

Are you talking about me?

What's a concubine?

A what?

A what?

My what?

Your cell is more than adequate.

Come, Sister.

Mary Clarence!

You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?

Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.

A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?

But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?

Oh?

You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.

'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!

He didn't do you a favor.

Then-you run.

It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.

I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?

Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?

How?

What?

I think they'd understand.

Even nuns have to pee.

That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.

You found him -- but we're not open yet.

Yeah...

Maybe pants.

Which one!

She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!

Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.

Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.

That was exciting!

It's better than ice cream.

Christy.

She said they were from her old convent.

But where?

Many have.

To place it inside its coffin.

... Brom Bones...

Bring him.

What?

All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...

Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!

I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.

Master Hardenbrook...

Is that all you say?  Look at her.

Up.

The Western Woods.

Father said witches live there.

Listen.

Should we go back?

To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.

There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."

It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.

Take the reins.

I doubt that's the end.

Tired.

Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.

May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?

You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.

The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.

I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.

If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.

What troubles you?

What?

If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?

What would you have me believe?

He moves too fast.

To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?

Close your mouth!  Keep silent.

May I see my mother?

She did not do it... please listen...

Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.

Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.

I like them french-fried potaters.

Can I see him?

Give me the big'uns.

Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?

Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?

You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.

Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.

He does make some funny noises.

What?

Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.

But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.

You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.

Don't tell me what to do.

Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.

Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.

You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?

I hate you!

That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.

A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.

I aim to kill you with it.

They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.

I reckon I feel all right.

How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?

I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.

I like the way you talk.

Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.

Yeah, I recollect it.

Pull on your works. Your privates.

He ain't no count.

I don't reckon I know.

Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.

Yes sir, I reckon it does.

You will? For sure?

We'll be on teams, me and you?

Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.

Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.

I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.

Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?

Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.

I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.

I'm glad of it, honey.

They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.

Did Karl go to bed?

Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.

I love you, too, Mama.

Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.

I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.

I reckon.

I ain't got no boy.

I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.

You better go get your things.

Naw.

Yes sir.

My history.

I could shore use some. Thank ye.

Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.

Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.

What's that you say?

How long have you been standing here?

Oh. How about before that?

I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.

Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.

I know.

Vaughan, don't get pushy.

Yes sir.

No thank you.

Before they were married?

Better make it charge. 

It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.

What's the difference?

Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."

Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?

No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.

It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.

I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.

It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.

You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.

I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.

Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.

Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.

That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.

Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.

It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.

We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.

Uh, better make it one.

Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.

Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.

You got it.

I mean, it's a good story.

I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.

It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.

And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.

I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.

Where to?

I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.

You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.

I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.

I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.

Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.

Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?

Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. 

And why the hell would you give me money?

Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?

Huh?

The refrigerator?

Thomas? Who's Thomas?

Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.

Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!

Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?

And you told your nephew about it?

And?

Jesus.

And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?

I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.

It'll cost you five bucks.

Not a one.

What's your offer?

And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.

Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?

Well what?

I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.

Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.

Yeah? And why is that?

Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.

I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.

Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.

Well, maybe just one. To be polite.

You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.

You can't be more specific than that?

Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.

Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.

This is the first house I've been in without a TV.

Nice drawing. Did you do that?

Eight-thirty?

It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?

No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.

I don't know. For helping me out.

If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.

What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.

No way.

It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.

Absolutely. We would be honored.

His only copy?

Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.

Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.

It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.

It wasn't my fault.

Good. I'm glad that's settled!

It's all right. I really do know them.

If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 

Medium rare, please.

Yes, please.

Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...

Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.

Carl Heine's type.

No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.

That's obvious.

So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.

Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.

All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?

Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?

At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.

Well, I don't do it for just anybody.

Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.

Those aren't the facts that matter.

...but he found you.

What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.

These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.

My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.

Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.

Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!

I have told the truth.

Yes.

Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.

Three kids.  What's she going to do?

You're wondering why I held it.

Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?

You ever been strangled by a single hand?

Naw, I had that around for a while.

Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.

You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.

Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.

That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.

You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.

Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.

A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.

He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.

No.

I don't think so.

Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.

Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.

But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.

I can't speak for him.

That's all he said.

I suppose you want a tip?

Beat it, Buster.

It's entirely mutual.

Fresh!

What did he say?

Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.

Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.

Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?

I thought you weren't talking to me.

We're not too late, are we?

But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -

The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.

What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.

I never did like the name Geraldine.

I'm Josephine.  Sax.

Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.

I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -

Then pull the emergency brake!

Good night, Josephine.

We can get a job with another band. A male band.

All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?

You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -

Of course, you're not.  I'm going.

No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.

He's going to be ashore with you.

I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.

I am.

His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.

Like what?

Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -

Shut up and keep packing.

Get me Room 414.

We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.

That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.

Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.

I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.

I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.

If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.

No.  It's nice and cozy.

You got some?

What's the surprise?

Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.

That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.

What's that?

Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.

Vanity Fair?

Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.

Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.

I met one of them.

Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -

You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.

Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -

Help yourself.

You don't say.

I'm not surprised.

Why?

I'll throw up!

You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.

Yes, Osgood?

Sorry.

We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.

Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -

I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -

My car?  Why, you -

It's not the backs that worry me.

All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?

There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.

Oh.

That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!

I'll say.

I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!

Going to catch yourself a rich bird?

You're entitled.

Well, now that you've mentioned it -

I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.

Just my feminine intuition.

My fault.

It's been delightful meeting you both.

Looks like they're on the wrong track.

Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...

You're flattering me.

Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.

Nothing at all?

Oh, no!

You poor, poor boy.

If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.

I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.

It's like smoking without inhaling.

I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.

From a rich millionaire.

Me?

Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...

You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.

Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.

It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -

Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.

I know.  Every time!

Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?

If you want to, you can call your lawyer.

Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?

Me?  I was at Rigoletto.

I cut myself shaving.

I sleep with my spats on.

Pub Golf?

When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.

What? Why? What do you mean?

Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.

Or Kat....

Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.

I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.

Mom, please.

I had to say something to get you here.

Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.

Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.

Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.

Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.

Is that why you brought him? Because of me.

Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.

I slept with your sister.

I dont do naked. My sister? She does naked.

Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.

Love.

Youre too good for him.

Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.

You stand on your tiptoes.

I think thats disgusting.

I have a friend at the magazine.

What?!

This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.

Okay.

No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.

Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.

Oh, cut the crap!

He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.

I didnt say he was worth it.

Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.

What?! No, no. You cant--

Thank you.

Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.

Of course, dont be silly.

Its complicated, Dad.

Hard.

Will do.

You don't live around here, do you?

I try...

What he talk 'bout?

He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.

It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!

What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.

Yes, mam...

She was dirty and wet...

It was too dark, Daddy.

Yes, sir...

Where did the sun go to, Daddy?

What happened afta that?

We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?

Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!

Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.

Sausage and hambones!

Goodnight.

That's right!

Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.

David, come back here!

I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.

I'm used to it.

What did the Lord tell you, Ike?

Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.

What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?

I'll wait till after the children.

I wanta see Nathan.

I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.

You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!

Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.

The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!

Montana.

OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--

Sheet!

Okay.

Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.

Oh.

Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!

What?

Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-

Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.

More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!

YOU DO?!

Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!

But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!

Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.

Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-

Something big, children.

Hey, Chef.

It's... It's not good children.

Oh no, it's that kid.

Doky maping she deeder!!!

Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!

Mph rmph rm rmph rm?

Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!

Mrph mprph!!

Dude, what the hell is going on?

You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.

KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!

Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?

YOU BASTARD!!

You bastards!!

Our moms suck!

Yeah, so what do we say?

Me?!

Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-

He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.

Oh.

No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.

You bet, Terrance!

Hello, Brooke Shields!

The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?

Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!

Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.

Hey, come here, guy.

I am.

I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-

Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!

I know.

Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.

<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>

Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!

Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?

Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!

Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.

What's the matter, Wendy?

You didn't?

I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.

Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -

Magnificent, magnificent.

Very professional of you.

They are awaiting further information.

Well shut it off at once!

Well it's a good thing that I did.

Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.

Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?

I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?

That's me.

Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.

Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!

Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!

Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.

I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.

Will you shut up already?

Like open an airlock by mistake?

Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.

Sure.

Words to live by.

A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.

Barnes?

I'm about to blow the wall.

How does the distress signal look?

Hopefully sooner than later.

It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.

Is there anything I can help you with?

Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.

There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!

Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.

I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.

Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.

What do you want with old man Faz?

You afraid we're gonna steal it?

Are you guys bruddas?

La da da dalala...

How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!

Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.

You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.

We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?

I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.

You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.

I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.

You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.

Don't say that about my mom!

Fuck you and fuck bowling.

I didn't think so.

I couldn't care less.

I am underground.

Clam it!

He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.

Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.

Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.

You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.

Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.

Junior who?

You know who I am?

Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!

Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.

Who wants to know?  Zeus!

Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.

He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...

I'd rather you didn't.

Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.

Sheila, please.

Really? I kinda like it.

If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.

You're here.

Why not?

He's my father.

It?

What about plan C?

I'm not here to bowl.

Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.

What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?

Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?

Two and a half days?

Forty yards.

Now!

Pull it, damn it!

What team?

From what?  What's with all the security?

They didn't tell me anything.

What?

Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?

As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.

Geologists?

-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.

ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?

But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.

I don't know.  But it's something alien.

I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.

What do you mean, he's missing?

No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.

Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...

Working on it now, sir.

Well, where the fuck is he?

They've left, keep watching!

In a minute, sir.

So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.

The what?

Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.

Please watch your closest monitor...

She's not gonna know.

If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.

Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.

What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.

What do you make of this?

What sub?

Underwater?

What -- are you threatening me?

So what?

What?

You did, didn't you?

You bastard.

Don't bother me, Norman.

You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.

He what?

Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.

What do you mean, a part of Harry?

How can the sphere do that?

Which I told Barnes was attacking --

Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.

Valdomet.

Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.

Antihistamine.  For bites.

I'll just boost the doses.

How fast does it take effect?

Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?

Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?

If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?

Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.

Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?

No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?

It's not safe for you to be either.

Hear what?

Who says it's a he?

Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.

Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.

I'm not being defensive.

Wait a second, I --

Which one?  Let me get the list out.

A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.

Then what, Norman?

What noise?

Page 87 of what, Harry?

What are they?

Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.

Did I?

I don't think so.

Help me lift her.

Are you trying, damn it?  Just --

No idea.

Wait!

Nine hundred feet to surface.

You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?

Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.

Please.  It must have flown here --

It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.

"We are friends".

Really?

Like what?

I don't see anything.

Why's that?

Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.

You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.

The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.

I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.

A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...

Oh, so you're a warrior then?

I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.

I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?

Could I learn to feel it?

Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.

I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.

Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.

I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.

Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.

You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.

But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?

What's that?

Send one squad up.

Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.

I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.

It's automatic.

You don't believe in the Force?

Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.

They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.

I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.

That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...

Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...

Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.

I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.

I read you sir.

I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.

See Threepio!  Do you copy?

I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.

What do I want with a scar ?

Yes, sir !

Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.

Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.

Ace of spades.

Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?

I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...

Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?

Only when I give you an order.

Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...

Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.

Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.

Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?

You and me, huh ?

THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !

So who's got time to get married ?

Funny...

Carl can wait.

Who cares ?

Shhh...

Naw, I made it, Carl made it.

Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.

Alright, I love you.

I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !

Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.

I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !

See you on the bounce !

We've gotta go get her !

Yes, ma'am.

No way, ma'am !

Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...

That's it, we're empty ma'am !

Guess you gotta go.

You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.

High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...

I don't stay where I'm not wanted.

I'm gonna need a squad leader.

Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !

Oh, is that how it is ?

Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.

It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.

Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.

Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...

Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?

Good luck. It's not there anymore.

He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.

Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.

Sir, thank you, sir !

Sir, yes it is, sir.

Uh, no.

I'm gonna save Carmen.

This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...

What is it, Rico ?

Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.

Yes, sir...

Yes, sir.

V'ger is that which programmed me.

That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.

Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.

The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.

By the Creator.

Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.

You are what...?

May I ask Why?

I'm aware of that, sir.

Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.

Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.

No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?

That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.

How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!

Captain... I'd like to go along...

That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.

That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!

Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!

Our Exec and Science Officer...

Twelve seconds...!

Ten seconds....

Viewer, standard ahead.

Viewer ahead, sir.

See that it is.  Take me over, please.

Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'

I want him here.  Sit down!

And whatever you sensed out here....

Any reply from them?

Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!

A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.

'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'

There is no alternative.

... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.

That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.

Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.

Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...

Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...

Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.

Helm ready, sir.

Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?

Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.

Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.

Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.

That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?

You wrote a play on it, what play is that?

I beg your pardon?

Don't be so hard on yourself.

First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.

It was either that, or a sardine.

That's true.  You grow up here?

Yes...

Yes...

I understand...

Goodbye.

I live there.

That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...

Mmm.

Yes...

You're still here.

I love your script.

<u>Yes</u>...

That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...

Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!

...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.

They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.

Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?

One moment.

You going to ask me in?

You believe that?

I used to go out with a politician.

Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.

They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.

Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...

Hi.

...the better to eat me with, your dear?

But that's what happened.

I'm going to tell the truth.

Water or mineral deposits.

Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.

We'll work it out...

Courthouse back in town.

Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.

Hi.

Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...

Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...

...they run on water.

Fifteen hands.

Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.

Uh, <u>look</u>....

...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.

I loved it...he...

We missed you in Church today, Frank.

But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.



I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.

What...

I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...

Well, what's the beef?

I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...

Cool it, Babe, you started this...

I like you, too.

Who is that...?

Oh.

Is...Is the Movie!

...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...

I...

I'm only trying to...

...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...

He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?

That isn't very nice.

I can't tell.

Well.

Who got their heads cut?

You said <u>three</u>...?

I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?

Main Street.

Doug, this is Mr...

I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:

Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...

This young woman.

What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?

My wife just went into labor...

A witness to what...?

You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?

I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.

You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?

My wife is going to have a baby, and...

Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?

That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...

I hurt my finger.

I'm out.

Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...

The breasts symbolize motherhood...

What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?

We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...

Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...

<u>Pay</u> her.

No no no no no no no no no find me the money...

...not the Lazyboy...

And we're glad to have you here...

That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...

...it is?

George, that is so kind of you.

Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...

Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.

I killed her!

I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.

Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...

I live.  In the same country.

But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...

Like how?

I'll be there for you.

Secret's safe with me.

You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!

...I'm not deaf, y'know.

And...?

She is but an arriviste.

Great.

Maybe twenty.

Mom?  What's wrong?

And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?

Don't. Take me with you.

Yes.

I'll miss you so much.

I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.

Here.

Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.

Thank God for that!

This is my daddy's house --

You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!

YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?

No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.

&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;

Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...

IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.

I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?

No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.

Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.

Where are you, anyway?

Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.

Before you.

Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.

I helped.

Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.

Every day.  More and more.

Sooner than later.  You really need to.

Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --

But you're not <u>done</u>!

We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!

I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!

It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.

Easy enough.

Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!

I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.

And I'm supposed to care.

No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.

Never stand between that kid and a meatball.

This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...

I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.

What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?

Why not just bring the whole toilet?

...it's my problem, too.

She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.

Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.

You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.

And you said...

Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...

Thanks, but it's under control.

It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?

Do what you've worked your whole life to do?

Is that what he told you?

Who in the world <u>is</u> he?

Don't be too sure.

Give 'em my number.

Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?

Worked.  Like a charm.

Oh please.

Uh.  You hate my guts?

It was a veal stock, I thi...

So I'll have to order in?

Jesus.

I trust you of course I do but --

No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --

Rache, get out of th...

I think so...What do you think?

I know that.

By way of saying you were unhappy.

That's not us.

I'm gonna get me a drink.

Does Jackie know this?

What if he is?

What?

Oh, yeah?

Oh.

Thanks, Scoob.

He was in a concentration camp?

But I thought he came over to America before the war.

I'll be your guest!

Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.

Four brothers and five sisters.

No.

I'm still poor.

No.

My grandchild-baby.

He's dead.

Jesus was not bad.

He wasn't.

For rape and murder.

Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.

Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.

Oh. What happens now?

You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.

Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!

Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.

Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?

Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?

Just the same.

Yeah?

Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.

Tired of this shit...

And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.

I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.

'Fuck me hard!'

Again!!

Hello, is this Pam?

Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.

Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.

I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.

I'm a documentary filmmaker.

Hunh.

Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?

Yeah, sure.

It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.

No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?

Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.

Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.

I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.

I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.

You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.

What do you think?

What are you talking about?

Where does it lead?

Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!

Like where--in your dreams?

Yes, you should.

We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.

I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...

I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.

I say we head out.

Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.

Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?

We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.

How much of this shit do they have, White!!

Moffo!

Don't be ridiculous.

Yes, of course.

It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.

Oh, yes, that's right.

I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.

The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.

Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.

Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?

Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!

That's government property, Major.

What did you say?

What did you say, sir?

General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.

Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.

What kind of trouble?

Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --

To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.

That certainly would be a problem, sir.

No, sir.

I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.

Plan-R????

Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?

Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?

You're damned right they are.

Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.

When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?

Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?

Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.

Not yet, Major.  Not yet.

Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.

Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.

We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.

Admiral Buldike?

That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!

General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?

Naturally I am, sir.

Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---

Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.

Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?

Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.

What?

War?

Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.

They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.

They're moving apart.

Ready, Major.

Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!

Some kind of signaling.

Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.

Forget it.

Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.

Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.

Check, ten thousand air burst.

Master Kong.

All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.

I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???

Listen, give me a shot quick!

Recall what mistake?

Look, this is different.

Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.

But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.

You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.

Let me check.

I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.

Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.

But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!

But who would be chosen?

Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.

Knock yourself out.

It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.

Was it okay?

Yes.

Yeah, when's he coming?

Hey. Do you have a cigarette?

Hey, you said you did a video?

A cloud?

Now?

Needs some pizza in his diet.

Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.

You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.

Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?

What?

That's the rock star thing.

Okay.

Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?

No, no.

Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?

No.

You know?

What, they're looking for her?

Erica is in the van back there.

Buff...

She's dead.

Look, Tim confessed to me last night.

Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.

No.

Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?

I will.

That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.

Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!

Are you talking to me?

Good. See you later.

Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.

I could.

Okay. We'll go for a ride.

Mm.

What about me? I don't have a car.

Oh, yeah?

Mm.

Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.

Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.

It does look good.

He causes problems. He was here earlier.

Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.

Wow, that must be pretty nice there.

Ask your girlfriend.

No.

Yeah, fuck 'em.

That chick, Erica?

Wow. You did that for me?

I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.

Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?

That's right.

Look, look, just get off my property.

About what?

No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.

What? What do you stand for?

Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.

... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.

Sooze.

Nothing.

So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?

No. No, no, no.

Wait. What, what are you saying?

Oh, fuck it, man!

Just go.

Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.

Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.

Nah, nah, nah, nah.

Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.

Yeah.

Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!

Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.

What?

Oh, yeah.

Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.

Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!

This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.

Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.

Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.

I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.

I get final approval. It's in my contract.

Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?

If...

Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?

So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?

Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.

She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.

Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.

... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?

Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.

Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?

You have the largest penis. Can we go please?

Come on, Jeff.

Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.

No car.

You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.

I just pulled and it - it came off.

Sorry, Kansas...

Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.

It's twins!!

Wayne Gretzky.

Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.

Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?

It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!

No...I've been pregnant.

You sure?

"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...

Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?

If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?

Of course - of course!  Hands in...

Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.

I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.

Jack...

Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.

Jus some girlie things for the squad.

I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"

We're here for you, Diane.

Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?

Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.

Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!

We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.

Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.

Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."

Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!

Bank branch!

Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.

I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.

So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...

So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!

Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.

Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.

Stop it!  This is crazy!

I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...

That was the general idea.

Where's the bar?

I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?

Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.

I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?

I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.

I just think pictures should say a little something.

Dark Windows.  How did you like it?

Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.

I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.

I tell you this is half sold.

You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.

This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.

Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...

I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.

Nobody can be that busy.

You're tough, all right.

Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.

Second generation, huh?

Nice job.

Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.

I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?

Whose house is it?

That was Norma Desmond on the phone?

Come on, Joe.

Joe, I can't look at you any more.

It's a good script, isn't it?

That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.

Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.

Get out!

Uh-huh.

And you'll play Salome?

Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.

Thank you.

Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.

Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.

Are you married, Mr.  -- ?

Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.

Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.

It's those feathers.  They tickle.

It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.

This is the right day.

I ran into some people I knew.

Where are your...?

Yes, Norma.

All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?

You think I made that up about the gun...

Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.

I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.

That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.

It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.

It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.

It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.

Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.

Frankly, no.

Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.

Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?

Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?

Yes, Madame.

You know better than to interrupt me.

Say that I'm busy, and hang up.

Thank you, Max.

All right.  Camera!  Action!

Softball.

You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.

I've been saving it. For the right moment.

No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.

It's for your own protection.

I have to.

Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?

It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.

Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.

What's that?

Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.

It's paradise . We could be very happy here.

You can't just abandon me.  Alone.

Are you asking me for a "date"?

What?

What an adorable hat.

Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.

Well...I guess I can't.

Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.

Can I quote you?

The scoop of the year!

How do you know?

Did anybody notice you?

I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.

Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.

You're supposed to guess.

This is all your clothes?

He's nice.

You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.

You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.

It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.

Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.

It's the most beautiful place in the universe.

Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?

I know.

No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.

What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.

I knew it!

You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.

Going to try. Didn't say I could.

Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?

I seem to be.

For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.

And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.

It sure is.

I didn't --

You thought that?

Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.

There's a lot of choices here.

Me too. That's why I put this one up.

Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.

Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.

Kent!

What!

Say!

I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.

They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!

Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.

First paycheck?

So where is all them half-centses?

Say what?

Say who?

Black or regular?

Which country?

A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.

Yeah, yeah, I can do it.

Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.

Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?

Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.

I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!

Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.

I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?

Sister! I'm his sister!

Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.

Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.

Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.

Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!

Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.

Hey, I know a lot of things!

Where do you usually find a light switch?

How'm I supposed to turn this thing?

Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?

Missing????

My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.

Hello.

How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...

What's wrong?

Where did it come from?

So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--

Wait for Gus to get here, sis.

When was the last time you heard me sneeze?

Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.

Be my guest.

I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?

Lois, I . . .

We'd better talk.

Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.

Let's go to my place.

I'm sorry.

You're not selfish at all.

Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.

Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --

Does she know about it? She's in it!

Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.

So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.

Why am I doing this? Why am I here?

I'll be alright.

It's beautiful.

How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.

Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.

My kind of people.

I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.

Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!

Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .

Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .

You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .

In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.

Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.

		DELETE IN CUTTING

Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!

I'm sorry to see you go.

Like me?

I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.

Mr. White, come with me I want to see

Daddy . . . ?

Superman gets mail here?

But why the hair?

Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.

My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.

For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.

You are . . .

You are . . . nothing. I am father now.

First, I have fun.

You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!

Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?

High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.

Thank you.

I've been on the job.

Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.

But otherwise it's swell.

Unbelievable.

You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.

Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?

Oh.

No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.

The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.

So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.

What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?

You think he's for real?

I didn't say a word.

But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --

There was a recipe on the back  --

Lex is going bye-bye.

What other one?

You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -

But so is Vond-El

It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.

What's your name, boy?

Folks'll ask question.

Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.

Twenty-four.

Oh, God! I'm going to die!

Not a chance. It's too nice a night.

You think they're strange?

It's not bad.

195 pounds.

I guess I...uh...regressed.

Otis...

Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.

Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?

Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?

I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.

For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.

I'm fine.  Still working with my father.

Which one?

Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?

It turns to steaming piss.

I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.

Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.

You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.

The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.

Was it good?

Okay.

I'm not sure.

Billy, please.  The children.

Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.

Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.

When the game's over, I guess.

It's natural.

Good night.

Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.

You believe that?

Well I don't.

Berries.

Berry-picking.

What other people?

Yes.  Abbot understands these things.

Why would he be frightened?

Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.

Isn't it a lovely day?

Summer's over.  It's fall.

It's interesting.

I feel like a princess.

Yes.

So he was mean?

She...she was a friend of mine.

At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...

No.

Why are you calling me, Zoe?

No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.

Yes.

You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.

Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.

What is it?

If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...

Who did they get for that?

Excuse me?

Do you have this agreement with you?

No.

Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?

And where did you sit that morning?

And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?

There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.

Positive.

I was scared.  And there wasn't time.

No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.

Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.

Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.

Very slick.

What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?

No.

I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?

It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.

But Charlene...

You don't know that.

Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!

I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.

Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!

And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.

Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?

Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.

Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.

I'm late for a date with a dame.

Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.

I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...

Why, has he bothered you before?

Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!

You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...

I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!

No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...

Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!

No, I'm not.  I'm not!

History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...

I don't believe it.

Not just this minute, J.J....

Are you finished?

Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!

Can't hurt...

I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.

No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.

Integrity - acute, like indigestion.

A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".

But not for anything I did today...

How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -

She knows now.

The man in jail is always for freedom.

J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...

Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!

You're incapable of the truth...

He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...

No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.

No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.

In his apartment -

I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.

That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...

What kind of an act is this?

What sort of thing?

Nothing I didn't think of you before.

It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?

I hate to see you like this --

Yes.

Temple, I caught your act the other night and -

- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.

You tell him, I stutter!

Yes, but why?

Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!

What ship?

...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.

Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?

Steve, stop it please...

Why did you call me?

Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...

But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...

What chip?

In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?

Now listen to me very carefully.

Let me try mine.

Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!

That is one of my mission parameters.

"Hasta la vista, baby"?

No problemo.

Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.

I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.

Remember what I said, you can't...

I'm sorry, John.

Where'd you learn all this stuff?

Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.

Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?

Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.

I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?

Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.

Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.

Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.

Unknown.

Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?

Can you get us in there, past security?

Please continue...

Relax now, Sarah --

On all what?

I'm Steve. What's your name?

Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?

You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.

They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.

Your manner.

David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?

Colonel. Pleasure.

Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?

There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.

What museum?

Then you're going to kill me.

Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.

There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.

Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.

If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?

I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.

I don't remember in detail, there were so many.

It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.

They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?

Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?

No!

Tell me about von der Null.

And what did he say?

Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?

This is absolute nonsense!

But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!

Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.

Do you know Hans Hinkel?

Do you know what's in this archive?

Helmuth.

How could I forget?

Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...

Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.

His private life?

Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.

I don't know what you mean, Major.

Sure.

They said I was dogged?

Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.

Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?

The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.

Alright!

It's not brain surgery, Chuck.

Wrong.

That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.

I thought you did.

That's none of your business.

The what?

It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.

About where you're from.

What about it?

Molecular-memory.

That's the way it was told to me.

Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.

Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.

You must have had a fun child-

Someone?

You'll beg for mercy in a second.

We did it, Kyle.  We got it.

Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...

Of course.

Okay.

I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.

Shut up.

The stock will turn.

You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...

You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.

I said I was sorry...

I don't think he's breathing.

He's turning blue!

You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?

I don't understand why they're getting you involved.

It's not like anyone could actually open it.

Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!

Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?

Hm?  Oh, yes.

I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.

Seriously?  What did they say?

Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...

I don't...

Get out.

What are you talking about... ?

How many times have you done this? I'm interested.

I'm back from the dead.

You call them...

What are you doing?

Stop talking to them!

Stop talking...

Studied acting, I assume?

Single?

Underwear?

Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.

"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.

They'll be wanting it back.

Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?

I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.

"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?

Like a stroke?

C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.

You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.

No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...

Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.

Yes, very lucky.

What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...

What is?

No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?

What kind of vacation?

Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".

Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...

No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...

What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.

I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.

It was a different floor then...

The key?

No, you didn't...

Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?

He came to my mind recently, that's all.

His behavior... ?

I know who she is.  Take a message.

Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...

Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?

Nothing.  Nothing at all.

Don't ask.

It was a misunderstanding.

Nothing else?

You're joking.

You warm my heart.

Uh... Nell Vance...

Well, I... uh...

I did okay.

I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.

Sure.

There's a carriage house around back.

Just stay there, Nell!

And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.

No.

The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.

Where in the hell can she be.

And that will be a good place to end this study.

She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.

I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.

Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.

But there's a sad catch to the story.

That smell... oh, God.

In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.

I got more scared.

And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!

Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!

Good.

Good morning, Theo.  Luke.

I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?

Who?

This?  It's from a thrift shop.

I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?

My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?

Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.

I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...

I don't know what to think anymore.

-- What do you think?

I used to hate it.  Now I like it.

Then what good is he?

Is that a problem?

For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.

Sure.

All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.

Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.

We think?

Okay.

Where do we go?

I wouldn't talk.

Lookin' good.

I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.

I only asked.

She didn't write to me, did she.

Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.

Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.

Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.

Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.

I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.

No one else is even here yet.

Faith.

That would be too easy.

What post office?

Hard to miss.

Not her brand.

In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.

Yesterday.  Afternoon.

Nah, accommodation address.

Something like that, yeah.

-- Mr. Lindgren.

Based in London, but with international concerns.

Why not.

She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.

Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.

A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.

I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.

Just now?  Overnight?

It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.

Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?

A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.

What's in Big Sur?

Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.

Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.

Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.

Eh?

And that is?

Ian?

Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.

Five thousand.

Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?

I don't know.

So what.

And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?

"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.

I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.

Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.

Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?

No trouble.

-- You know his name is Frank.

I don't.

The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--

Hello, Birdy.

Geez, Mr Crane.

I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--

Huh.

Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.

I can get it, yeah.

Ed.

Maybe.

Cash.

That'll be fine.

Look, uh... Creighton...

And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--

No, Dave, I wasn't.

Mm.

How's business, Dave?

What is it, Dave?

Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.

Well, you know what that would do to me.

I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.

$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.

He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.

Mm.

Mm.

Honey...

How are you?

What happened to you?

You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.

Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.

I don't know. I don't think so.

Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.

And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...

...a puny player on the great world's stage...

...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...

Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?

I know who you are, Mr Crane.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah--go home.

Huh?

...Nah.

He's the dead guy.

What'd he say?

My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.

Hello.

Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...

Uh... you're under arrest.

I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!

Let's go!

Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!

Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.

I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?

Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?

This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.

Pardon my French, but bull shit.

The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?

What is it?

There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.

Oh shit.

I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.

You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.

Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.

That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.

We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.

Yes.

He's right.

Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.

Don't be a wuss.  Come on.

Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.

They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.

Keep the light up.  I can't see.

What's that?

What kind of hormones?

Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!

You loved him.

You were afraid of him, weren't you?

I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?

Would you mind showing it to me?

I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.

Where did you see it?

I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?

We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.

Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.

Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.

It's coming.  Run.

I can't!

Why wouldn't I?

What's to see?

He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.

What have we missed?

Amnesia.

It has to be the reality.

Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.

No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.

And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.

We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.

Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on "Tru Talk."

Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--

You think she'd go through with it?

Oh, yes.

That's right.  Lauren.

If we don't go now, it won't happen.

I...I can't.

So when are you leaving?

--Truman, what are you doing here?

Your Dad?!

Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.

Gee, that's great.

I'm sorry, I'm late.

I won't be here Sunday.

What?!

There's been an accident, Truman.

I bet you did.

I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.

I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.

I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?

Things always do--when you look back.

When you get to Fiji?

The whole area's being evacuated.

Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.

We don't even know you.

No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.

Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.

Looking for him for what?

No. Just fossils, far as I know.

Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.

No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.

And one little boy.

Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --

I'm not sure. A virus --

What did it look like?

What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.

No you didn't.

Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?

All I told them was the truth.

They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.

Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.

No.

Get dressed, Scully.

Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.

Evidence of a massive infection.

Mulder --

Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --

That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.

I don't know, Mulder.

That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.

-- of what exactly?!

I don't know.

You can't quit, Scully.

We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --

Just like that --

I think... something stung me.

Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...

I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.

She was with me.

I've got to find Scully.

What happened to Kurtzweil?

What alien environment?

In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!

And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.

You need not kill a man to destroy him.

A pocketful of rye...

Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.

Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.

Lucien Baines?

If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.

Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...

And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.

No.

Okay.

Four and twenty blackbirds...

As far as I needed.

Peter, okay?

Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.

Then what is he?

If you believe that.

What happened to Charles Gish?

"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."

You're kidding me.

I think that's the whole point.

What's wrong?

She's bringing Stargher into hers.

That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.

Prevacid.  For my stomach.

I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.

Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.

Awaiting his arrival.

Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.

Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!

She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.

Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.

I don't have to.

Considering where I've been...

Sit down.

He has a little dog.

That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.

The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.

The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.

Comedy. I don't play tragedy.

It's just what he used to say.

If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.

What's the matter?

Me.

A parrot...Let it go.

Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.

Oh...

I'm sorry.

Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.

They're Harry's.

No.

I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.

I don't know.

I was a friend of Harry Lime.

Just around the corner.

Yes.

No.

Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.

When did you see him last?

No.

What?

Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.

Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?

Thank you. Excuse me.

I see.

We'll never get him in the Russian zone.

She's right. It's none of my business.

I'll be your dumb decoy duck.

This way, miss.

No, I don't know...

Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?

Certainly.

Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.

Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.

Yes.

You can help her.

And - Anna...

You can get somebody else...

Coffee.

What did he say?

What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?

In great pain?

Who?

Mr. Lime's.  Accident...

Yes, sir.

Mr. Lime - yes.

You saw it?

Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.

Who else?

Well make it your business.

What else?

Why no, Mr. Martins.

Never.

Yes?

Richard. Hi.

I'm sorry, I don't think so.

Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -

Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.

I'm sorry.

Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?

What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.

You can swim?

Hi there. Here, take a look.

No.

Uh-huh.

Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.

Yes.

No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.

Why the fuck not?

People still need values, beliefs....

You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.

Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.

You want it to be an event.

I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.

No.

Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.

Why not?

That's stupid.

It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.

Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...

No difference.

No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.

Don't curse in front of it.

Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.

'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.

You gotta get out of here.

Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?

I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.

Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.

It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.

He's Jewish? Manzetti?

We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.

Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...

How would you kill him?

It's the truth....

A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.

So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.

Are all Jews the same?

To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?

It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.

No.

Get the fuck away from me.

That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.

I can't help what I think.

You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?

I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.

Fucking kike.

Daniel Balint.

It's German.

I was going to ask you the same thing.

So what Jew would you kill first?

That's meat.

They're not my people....

Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.

You could do it.

Keep driving. Don't slow down.

You said they didn't have night guards.

I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.

No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.

Get out of my way.

I can tell....

Okay, that's it. You're going back to --

Dennis Leary.

No.

Obviously.

Danny, please, we don't want to know.

Eat shit....

Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.

... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.

No.

But your man isn't quite a God!

Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.

Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?

... So am I.

The documents are forged.

Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!

I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.

Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?

No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.

Congratulations.

Enzo, stop bitching, will you?

Yes, the Mamma is is there.

You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?

That idiot!

The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?

Six seconds.

Have the car painted.

Then tell him to wax it too.

You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!

Fine!

Great!

Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.

Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.

Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.

No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?

Thank you, thank you very much!

Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.

Who?

... Okay.  I'll try.

Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...

But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...

... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.

Uh... Ah!  A story?

You'll understand.

I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.

... Nothing.

It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.

No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?

Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.

Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.

No.  I'm just depressed.

Of course, that's what they're for.

Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.

Why is he doing this?

Coffee might be nice.

... Yes?

I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.

What's your first move?

Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.

Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.

I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.

It's Esther.

Please, call me Mordechai.

My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.

Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.

I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.

Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.

I said, yeah, about once a week!

Keep going.

I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.

You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.

...I'm not finished yet, mom.

Happy Hanukkah Morty.

Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.

I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.

Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.

He's still working out some identity issues.

I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.

The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.

Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.

No, it was the perfect level.

No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?

But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.

Where? Where did you find it?

You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.

I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.

Good evening.

It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.

You're worrying about its killing someone else?

Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.

No. I'm quite sure.

Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.

I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.

Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?

Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?

To know where that leopard went -  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up.

No - really, I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights 

Something's wrong with this whole setup --

Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.

You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.

Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.

Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.

Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...

I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!

Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.

The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.

Don't be soft.

And I suppose you don't feel bad!

We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!

Yeah.

You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.

Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.

Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?

Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.

Aint nobody out there, Mister.

You a tourist?

Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.

Excuse me?

Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?

Excuse me?

Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?

The man who sold the boy to your brother.

W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?

You do want me to keep the job, dont you, Mrs De Moraes?

How are you, Mrs De Moraes?

You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...

I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...

Why do I feel I neednt answer that?

Something like that.

Here we go again.

Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me, and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done, he said.  Were in deep trouble, he said. We, he said. We.  Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...

I dont know. Everyones dead...

Croissants. Like that...

A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.

Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.

Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.

Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.

Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For gods sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?

What about your friendly cop?

You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.

Huh! And they say charitys only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...

Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?

What sort have you got?

What about an untrained pup, white...

Tomorrow?

Where is he?

What kids?

Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...

I certainly did, sir...

La what?

Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?

Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, thats what they do to their employees, isnt it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives. Thanks for the lift!

Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. Its important.

Recommended?

Yesterday. It all looked normal.

He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.

Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?

Look, I dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?

Ill be alone.

Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?

Shut up! Wheres your wallet?

Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My fingers on the trigger, you hear!

Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.

Yes...You-youre not going to take Shiva away?

Hed come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... Sleeping Beauty. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldnt watch...

Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...

Hows the boy doing?

Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.

Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.

Would you know where I might reach her?

Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.

Tu sais où me trouver.

If you can, send me a receipt.

Who?  I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.

Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...

The acid bath?

Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. Its wrong. Fucking wrong.

Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.

Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.

Its a good guess...

I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?

Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...

Of course I am, it's just that...

So... pretend it's not a game.

Do you think I could have some water?

This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.

Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.

How dare you stop me doing God's will!

They've started the battle without me!

I promise...

But how do you know what you hear is the truth?

Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!

Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...

If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.

You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!

I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.

And so I... I prefer my banner.

Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?

You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?

... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?

Performing a miracle.

She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...

No no, I'm fine, really...

I will hear you... but not now, not here.

Nineteen... or thereabouts...

And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!

Yes.

Many things...

You have nothing to regret...

Silence her!  Take her away...!

Buying her?

Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?

He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.

Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.

Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...

No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?

His face.

I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.

For what?

Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!

You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!

Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...

Jeanne, look behind you.

The clothes are not important...

It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...

I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.

No...

That's now what I meant...

Nothing... just taking his teeth.

Why not?  He has good teeth...

Here -- take this instead.

Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?

... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!

My king.

Five steeds and a few hackneys...

Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...

YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?

WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?

You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...

No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!

Yes... lots of things!

No, but... he sent me so many signs!

Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?

In His name??

Yes, my lord.

I need to confess again.

I'm sure he'll forgive you.

Yes, it is.

I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.

Jeanne, be patient.

I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.

You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.

Wladek, please.

Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.

What?

I haven't seen him.

It costs.

Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!

Warsaw's not the only radio station.

We use what?

No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.

You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.

I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.

They were taking you away.

You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...

Yes, that's why I brought it.

should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.

Yes, so did the Germans.

You're amazing, Jehuda.

So, what's the news?

You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?

I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...

I didn't know you were in the certificate business.

Wladek! How are you?

Sorry, I don't remember.

I am... I was a pianist.

We're getting out.

I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?

Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.

Watch his hand

To be deaf?

Like it were a piano?

Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth

She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.

I'll be back.

She's stunted, that's one thing.

No, no they know another track - to the side of this.

Yes, I thought that.

No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.

You mean in signs?

No, not words.

What are they?

They are washed.

I just want to listen.

She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled

On your piano, that is the swap.

Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.

Who told ya this guy was in here?

I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.

He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.

Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.

What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.

Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.

Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.

Which way did he do, Eirie?

You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.

They workin' for anybody?

What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?

You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.

What do ya mean?

A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.

Yeh.

Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.

Fancies himself a gambler, huh?

He wants to put a half million on Syphon.

Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?

That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em.

Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.

Pass.

Raise 500.

If ya win it could make ya, too.

You're more gutless than I thought.

I'll square it with the fixer.

Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.

Think nothin' of it.

Where's June today?

Sixty-five.

2:00 A.M.

No.  What's wrong with the front?

No.

What the hell for?

How ya doin', Jimmy.

Three grand on the black, Jimmy.

He cheats.

I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.

That's worth fifteen grand to ya?

660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.

I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.

Give 'em a little time.

I'm in.

Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.

He's right, Les.

No.

Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.

No.

Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.

If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.

Yeh, but I don't know where he is.

He'll never do it.

Come on, gimme a break.

You know how they are... sex...

Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 

I'm sorry.

He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.

Another young man.

Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.

Do you think I care

Dorothy!

Shush!

I didn't.

It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.

Yes.

was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?

Disappeared!

I've got to see you alone!

Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.

Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 

You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.

Only in bad weather.

Gilbert!

I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.

Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.

I'm asking you.

No.

It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?

Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.

Nunheim!

Rosebreen.

Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.

He did!

When was that?

Did you go?

Why yes.

You don't think I had anything to do with it?

Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!

Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?

How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?

You've said that for weeks.

Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.

Just what I said I'd do.

So I see.

No.

Is Julia going with you?

I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.

Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?

I haven't been a detective for four years.

Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.

What do you think?

They'll want more than your word for that.

And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.

I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.

Much better, thanks.

Six Martinis.

That last Martini.

Santa Claus.

Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.

Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.

Well, didn't you?

That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.

Let's see.  Where's it from?

Your guess is as good as mine.

Maybe I will.

Catch me letting you go alone!

I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.

Not with all your money!

Sure I will.

Why, I believe the little woman cares.

Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.

Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 

It's the only way it makes sense.

No, Mr. Charles.

Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.

You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?

This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.

You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.

I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.

I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.

No, please, not again.

Yeah.

We can't just go off and--

Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.

Let me see the map.

I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--

You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.

Maybe I do.

Then get up and do something about it.

He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.

Why'd he come in our camp.

You said he was a deserter.

You don't know that.

What about Jaeger?

Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.

Knock it off!

No you're not.

Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.

Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.

Roger that.

Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.

I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!

I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.

I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!

Mine.

Just relax.

I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!

Epps...

It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.

Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.

You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!

What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?

The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.

So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.

I hope it means something, otherwise...

We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.

I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.

Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.

We'll find our way.

Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.

I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.

Yeah.

Damn.

Okay.  Then we go this way.

Don't you touch it.

Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.

With what?  Against how many?

The...the gold...

But...

Yeah.

Threatened to blow my brains out?

Thought you were going to buy a car.

I don't know.

He's going to slow down.

The photos.

They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.

People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.

Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.

Naw, nothing.

Like I said; so?

This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.

It's a container.  Break the seal.

Hell, we'll just buy our way out.

I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.

Yeah, well, we're not.

Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.

We make it, or we go back empty handed.

He lived through that?

You want to say some words?

Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.

We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.

Correct.  Origin?

Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.

What happened?

You've seen enough.

I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.

He wants me to come to his quarters.

Don't take anything.

No....I though  I'm afraid.

I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.

We could leave, and live in the superstructure....

AH UGH.

Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.

What?

It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.

We're leaving.

Incredible!

On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.

What?

Where is LUH?

Why are you so concerned?

I don't feel well.

That way.

What?

You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.

No......  She's dead THX........

Yes...

Thanks.

You the Bomb Squad?

Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...

That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.

Hey, look--

Just how easy is it to build a... device?

Look, it's a longshot...

Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.

I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.

Off the scale.

Stay to your left.

That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...

Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.

When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.

T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.

Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.

Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.

Helluva fuck factor.

Who is he?

Nothing... just tired.

Stay here.

What? Nobody, I-

And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.

Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.

That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.

I don't know...

Shit. We're fucked.

Look who's talking, old man.

Quiet!

It's about this.

Captain assigned me to assist you.

IRA - instant retirement account.

My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?

Someone who smokes French cigarettes.

That feeling won't last long.

It's detonation cord, for a bomb.

Yes, sir.

And diamonds in the front.

Diamonds all over.

Very well, Jacques.

Where did you find it?

He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.

That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.

No.

Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.

The type they marry.

I thought so.

Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!

Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.

But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?

Just a second.

I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.

I know it!

Now just a minute, Major--

No--no.

Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?

No, thank you.

Sweetheart, what day is today?

Darling!

He recognized you!

Spanish passports?

Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!

Yes.

Yes.

Well--I am Madame Colet.

The pleasure is mine, madame.

But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.

Oh! You didn't read it!

What's wrong now?

What?

Right!

You think that's too much?

That sounds sensible. 

And how I handle my <u>money</u>!

Um-hum ...

Together.

How do you like my dress?

Lipstick?

Good night.

I know all your tricks.

I know it.

Because I want to make it tough for you.

Call the police?

Giron...!

But it could have been glorious.

I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 

He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.

For all the really important things--

I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.

Very well, madame. Thank you. 

Because I hate him--because I love you!

Well, where is it?

Hurry, Rose.

Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.

Don't you mean work me?

I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.

That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.

How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!

Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?

So do I.

Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?

I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --

I'd rather be his whore than your wife.

Sure. Count me in.

What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --

Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!

Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.

Excuse me.

No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.

It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.

I've got you. I won't let go.

You're welcome. Rose.

That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.

Is he your boyfriend?

Yes, exactly!

Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.

Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.

I see you.

Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.

A mistake?

Jack, I --

To the stars.

It's okay. I'm alright.

Could it have damaged the ship?

He couldn't have.

I'll be right back.

It's so cold.

You think she was really there?

Goodbye, mother.

I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.

Sure!

I can explain--

Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.

Glad to see you again.

I don't understand.

Montana?

No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?

Where's Lother?

Want to take it back?

I'll say she is!

Yes--

Very much--

I could stand some more--

Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.

You work too fast for me, young man.

Very--your mother?

You asked me to dine with you tonight.

For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!

I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?

Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?

Lose?--I won a little--

I thought you were a smart guy.

It'll never hurt you---Got any money?

Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!

Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?

I'll take one. 

Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?

Get it!

Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?

That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.

Much better--thank you--

Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.

Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--

Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 

Coming to the pool for a swim?

It's a bet--come on, Sally!

You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?

Why, I--

She did?

What's that?

Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.

Sure.

Oh,--we're doing about thirty--

Well, did you find me?

Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.

Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.

Yeah--

Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.

News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--

I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?

What do you mean?

I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--

Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--

Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?

Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--

Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!

No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--

Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.

Good-night, folks.

Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.

The country boy's about due.

Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.

A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--

Say, "Thanks very much!"

Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.

I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.

You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?

What!--are you crazy?

Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.

That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.

Not now.  I don't have time.

Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!

Good.  That's real good.

I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.

Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.

But who was the Devil?

Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.

You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.

No...

A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.

That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.

Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.

All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.

You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.

I don't.

What?  But I saw 'em-

What was that all about?

What?

All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!

Colorado's closer

It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.

They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.

You know you almost got us both Killed back there?

You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?

I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.

Getting late.  We better get back.

Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.

Wait!

Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.

Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?

Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?

Honey, I gotta start makin' money.

No really, I can stay a while.

I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?

Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.

If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.

All right, run 'em off.

Drop his horse.

But this time they'll be ready.

They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.

Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.

Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.

I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.

Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.

They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.

Doc's just in no kinda shape.

Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.

Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.

I know, I need a keeper.

Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.

No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.

Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.

Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?

Yeah, and dangerous.

You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.

I see.

So why did you leave?

Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?

Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -

My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.

Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.

... 17 Beverage cup holders?

Nothing.

Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!

Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.

Fishing?

I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.

Something with an engine? Not oars?

Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?

Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.

Hell. The CIA built that club.

So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?

And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?

I hope so.

Think about mom.

- The family jewels?

No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.

It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.

Only what I read in the newspapers.

'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.

Of course.

... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?

Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?

Yes -

My timing always was lousy.

Excellent.

Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -

You come with me -  You stay here.

I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!

...Haven't we already paid him for his services?

...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.

One to seven: Deal the face cards.

Who is it?

Since when?

We got the same thing.

No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.

Yes.

You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.

My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.

And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?

I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.

It is just a regular card.

You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.

This would be a bad time for me to leave.

I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.

Why didn't you catch a plane?

That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.

I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.

You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.

Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.

It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.

I tell you, I feel like a ghost.

Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.

You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.

Tolerable well.

As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.

Hattie is a different person now.

What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?

Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.

Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.

Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?

I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.

What's a toby?

If it was left up to me, I would poison him.

Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.

Don't shout!

Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.

I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.

You know the man next door is near death.

Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.

No, I haven't seen him.

Sure!  I'll even let you drive.

Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?

Let's let Molly open one.

I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.

Mm-hmmmmm.

I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?

That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!

What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!

I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.

This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!

Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.

Alright Buzz, get ready...

Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --

What?!

I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!

Not today!

Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!

What's with him?

I can't see a thing!

Heh-heh.

He's in the psycho's bedroom!

Oh no, Hannah!

Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!

Will you quit moving around?!

All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --

Alright!  That's it!

That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!

No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!

Come on.  Let's get out of here.

Yes!  Yes!  We promise!

Hey look!  It's Buzz!

He got it, Woody!

I can't quite make out -- 

Uh-oh.

Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?

Sid!!!

Huh?

It's busted.

No, Slink --

Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.

Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.

There's no mirror.

You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.

A sin against <i>what?</i>

She got away.

Home is where the heart is.

Is that all?

Let me in.

I finished it off.

What difference does <i>that</i> make?

Storms?

Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.

I don't know what you mean.

Well, I hope it stays that way.

Why are you talking like that?

It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?

Carl, that's insane.

I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --

We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.

Does this mean you're going to be gone more?

I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.

So's the video camera.

Honey, your father knows the President.

How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.

Somehow, I don't see that happening.

Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.

Like I give a fuck.

I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.

Yeah.

I'm third in my class.

What is this, like freebase?

Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --

Have you done your homework, honey?

Nope.

Who do you work for?

So does half of San Diego.

Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.

Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?

Depends who it's from.

No --

We're playing!

You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?

I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --

So you pay off our customs officials?

When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.

No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.

That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.

You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.

It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.

Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.

Your new friends.

Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?

Where?

We agree.

Only if he can be trusted.

Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.

Any way we can do it better?

Just tell me where she is.

I don't know what to say.

The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --

I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.

Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.

Agents who died in the field.

It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --

No. On you go.

It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.

You've stabbed me, man.

But it's not worth more than fifteen.

Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

Can you not go yourself.

Jesus.

Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.

Thanks.

Diane.

It's where I live.

No, not holding hands.

Is that a promise, then?

Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?

Well, he's young and he's healthy.

It's an interesting theory.

Now?

Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --

Sorry about last night -

My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.

Another dab?

Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.

Eh - Ian Fleming?

What do you mean?

It wasn't that bad.

When are you going to visit him?

You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?

About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }

So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.

We're two thousand short.

Stick it on my tab.

It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.

Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.

No joy yet.

Went ballistic?

So what's it going to be?

But where?

I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.

No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --

It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.

And how did you breach the Barrier?

This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?

He doubts me.

Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!

Rescued at last.

And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.

I don't have a clue.

Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.

I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.

Have the Klingons responded?

What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.

Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...

Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.

Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.

Why didn't you beep my communicator?

Put it on the screen.

Go, Sulu.

I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...

Yes.

What do you mean?

Why?

Damn.  Let's go.

That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.

Yes, Captain?

I did not.

Why didn't you tell me this before?

This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.

The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.

You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?

Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-

The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?

I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?

Now learn something about yourself.

The ship needs its Captain.





Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.

No. I will not.

Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.

You haven't told him?

Senior exec.

I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.

Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...

Hi, Flynn.

I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.

I know, I met him.

Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.

Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set

Hello, Alan.

Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?

Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.

We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.

Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.

Not a chance.

I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.

Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.

I... have come to communicate with my User.

Where did you hear that name?

No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.

Yes.

Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...

How 'bout yourself?

PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.

Come here.

Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.

Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...

Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --

I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.

Why is everything...like this?

As long as it gets us out of here

Then I owe you some thanks...

Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!

I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!

So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*

Where are you going?

Where are you off to young lady?

You're kidding.

Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.

Will you just open the door!					*

Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--

See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.

Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*

Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*

You want me to just hang-- ?

Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.

It can't be.  Not Helen.

Put a tap on her phone.

Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.

Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.

Aw, it's gotta be a typo--

You tell on me, I tell on you.

What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?

You didn't have sexual relations with him?

There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.

... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--

Sorry.

Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?

I agree.

It's certainly... dramatic.

And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.

Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.

Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...

I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?

You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.

He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.

What did you need?

Do you still love your husband?

No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?

What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.

You wouldn't believe me.

Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.

Those idiots.

I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.

I understand.

Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.

Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.

I'm sorry, I can't.

I'm married!

Nope.

Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.

Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?

My name is Clarence, and what is yours?

Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?

What's your favorite color?

Would you like a bite of my pie?

Very much. Now, where were we?

Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".

Almost four years.

That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?

At the movies?

Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.

That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.

You didn't do nothing.

I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.

What?

Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?

I just gotta get somethin'.

Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.

Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.

It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?

Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.

You wanna get unhaunted?

Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.

You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.

She's with me.

You got it.

Ask him if he got the letter.

Now tell him goodbye.

Every word of it.

For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?

Elliot Blitzer.

The zoo.  What are you waiting for?

Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.

Yeah?

How 'bout me what?

What are we gonna see?

You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?

Want an animal cracker?

- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -

They'll be along.

No.

You are the dumbest person in the world.

I can see what you mean.

I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.

Thank you very much, Clarence.

I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.

A Norms in Van Nuys.

We grew up together.

Do you still have friends on the force?

I'm your son.

Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.

Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -

Uh-huh.

Absolutely.

I don't know. He just appeared as magic.

We talked him into it.

Not a tiny little vial -

Or a supporting actor -

'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -

This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.

How's he supposed to see the wire?

You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.

Rock whores.

Pussy love pink rocks.

Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.

Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.

Nigger, you lie like a big dog.

Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.

No way, JosÈ.

No.

Naw, he ain't home right now.

Do you know where we can find him?

No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...

Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.

We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.

You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?

For a man in your position...an opportunity.

You're still a little... disoriented.

Meaning...???

No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.

No.

You wouldn't understand.

What year is it?

What?

You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?

What?

You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?

Clues?  What kind of clues?

What will you do...when you find this...secret army?

James, why don't we...?

No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.

I don't know -- I don't remember.

It was?  I didn't...know.

I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...

You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...

You... you left them a message?

They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.

Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.

If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.

Well, you look pretty different, too.

I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.

No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.

Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.

I'm not crazy.

I'm here about some monkeys.

Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...

Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?

Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?

They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?

It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?

For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!

And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.

Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.

That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?

Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.

On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.

Christ no!

Yeah, yeah.

Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.

More or less.

We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.

Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?

Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?

Will be.

You got two years on me.  What's that make me?

Out of here.

You Harlin?

Harlin around?

Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.

Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.

Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.

I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?

If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?

Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .

Another accident?  You got to be more careful.

A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?

What?

I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!

What's it to you?

Genuine Draft?

I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.

Sheriff Potter.

There's someone in the house.

What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.

My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?

I don't know your real name.

What happened to your hand?

You should be more careful.

I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.

All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.

If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.

Thank you.

I guess it must.

It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?

Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.

If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.

Yeah, I guess you're right.

Yeah.

Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.

I can't.

Kill someone.  I can't do it.

It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.

Because I know you're full of shit.

Is that what changed your mind?  The money?

After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.

What was I supposed to do?

I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?

What about him?

Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.

You heard me.  Count it out.

Just drive.

What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.

I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?

I'm here.

What for?

You closed it, didn't you, Grace?

Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?

What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.

John Stewart.

Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.

I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--

That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?

Like you don't know.

Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.

No.

I was hoping we could talk.

You're talking like a mad man.

That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.

What makes you say that?

I need thirteen.

You didn't kill her?

I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.

Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?

Come on, Jake--

You're not talking sense.

What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.

Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.

What?

You're too quick for me.

I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.

That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.

Mister, I'm calling you out.

'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.

Oh, shit!

I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?

What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?

I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!

Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .

Jesus!

Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.

What for?

Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you.

You want something?

Christ no!

All right, old man.  Christ.

Who's cursed?

I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.

That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.

You expect me to believe that?

Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!

I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?

Give it to me!

Who the hell are you?

Accident.

Darrell's a moron.

Ah, I can smell it on you.

Like you don't know.

About things.  About your wife.

And what does that make you?

I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.

How do you want it?

You came to take my wife from me?

Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.

You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.

What?

That country shit all sounds the same to me.

You're too quick for me.

No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?

Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.

It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.

Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?

Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.

About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.

I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.

What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.

Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.

Darrell.

When I work on a car, I work on a car.

That's none of your business.  Get the keys.

You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?

It's Grace.

I pack up and go somewhere else.

Did you like it; me watching you?

Thank you.

It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?

Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.

They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.

No.

I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?

You could leave him.

Nothing I understand better than a mess.

He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?

You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.

Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...

Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.

Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...

If the key's on him, how do we get the key?

I thought you couldn't get your car.

Is that what changed your mind?  The money?

I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.

I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.

It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!

You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.

Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?

I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?

Bobby? Are you all right?

'Cause I love you.

He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!

Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.

But, in particular?

Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--

How much?

No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.

They look nice.

I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.

Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.

Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?

Yes.

I'll keep it in my office room.

I haven't been sick this year. I know that.

Do you remember me getting sick?

My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.

Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.

Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.

Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.

Is there a problem?

It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.

Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.

The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?

I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.

It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.

Yes he is.

Just one--

I'll help you.

No.

How much can you lift?

I see.

Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.

Is that right?

This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.

...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.

Where is it?

I fined 'em instead.

On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.

Innocent of what?

We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.

We was... lyin'.

I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.

Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.

Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...

I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?

You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.

Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...

Yup.

You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 

Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.

You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.

D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.

He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.

Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.

In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."

Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.

Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.

Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.

Huh?

Oh.

Huh?

You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.

If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.

You missed him? You didn't...?

You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?

You better get on back, Miss.

You ain't shot.

Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?

Whaddaya do, just use your hand?

Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.

What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...

You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?

Two.

Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.

Best we move that pig.

Who said that?

Thought you was followin' me.

Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.

Yeah?

We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?

Plenty of times.

Move the candle closer, I can't see.

Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.

Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.

An' if I spot 'em?

Just forget about it.

No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.

They'll never stop.

Alright.

I don't want to know.

I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?

The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.

How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?

Can we stealth these guys?

Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .

County. I was in for fraud.

Maybe more.

Russian, I think. I don't know.

I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.

Mr. Soze will be most -

We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.

Neither do we.

Business or personal?

Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.

Which is shit.

Waste of time.

Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -

That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.

You know a religious guy named John Paul?

He didn't have my lawyer.

I'11 be sure to mention that to him.

I'm not a rat.

He loved her.

And this is why you never told the D.A.

Can we just get back to Kobayashi?

But Keaton...

Edie.

Because he was my friend.

Why lie about everything else, then?

May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.

Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?

Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.

Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.

How did you settle on the amount?

And no one will know the truth.

... yes.  Get her on the phone ...

... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.

Yes.

I was her doctor.

...I was one of a group of...

Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?

What did these people do when her heart stopped?

Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?

Tell me one?

Well, we...

Yes.

My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...

No.

Through, through his book.

Huh!

Nothing further, your Honor.

You may step down.

...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...

The Doctors were not negligent.

No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.

I.  Yes.  It is.

... Deborah Ann Kaye ...

Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.

Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?

I understand.

...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?

I didn't do it, Mister.

I don't owe them a goddamn thing.

My client can't walk, your Honor.

Ready, your Honor.

No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.

Mr. Alito, please.

Let me talk to Mickey.

My subscription lapsed three years ago...

And what are you?  A cop?

You're talking like a drunk.

Yes.

I...do you want me to leave?

I don't have a goddamned idea.

Dr. Gruber's not in.

Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...

Oh shit, what's today?

All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?

I don't want a mistrial.

It's locked.

... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.

You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?

Mrs...

Yes.

Thanks, Franky.

Yeah.

Yes, the roving nurse...

Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?

Huh.  And why is that?

I married into it.

I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...

Have you talked to the doctors at all?

There are things you didn't tell me.

But you knew about this.

Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.

I -- I --

What for? Who are you?

Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?

Do you live here in the hotel?

What about?

You won't have to.

Your name. And --

-- and how you happen to be living here.

No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?

Because I remind you of her?

No.

I just want to see you as much as I can!

Yes.

Why?!

I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.

Honest?

But Scottie, you don't have to!

Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.

Yes. Yes, I do.

It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.

Too late. I've got my face on.

No, Ernie's is fine.

I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.

So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.

Take me away...

You can't. You're afraid!

Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?

Some money.

Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.

Where had you been before?

This afternoon.

You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?

Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.

I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?

The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.

Well... anywhere in particular?

Ah.  That's what I was going to do.

No birds live here.

Yes...

I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!

Yesterday.

Vaguely...

I know.

No. It's new and clean, and waiting.

No, never!

Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!

Too late... there's something I must do...

Madeleine!!

How long has she had the room?

When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.

Would you please go and look?

I thought you said no more aches and pains?

More than you think.

Why?

It's where you belong.

Ah, Johnny-O...

I'm having one now.

Uh-huh!

Normal.

You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.

Three whole weeks.

What.

Do you know him well?

And she died...

And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!

Carlotta?

Oh?

Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.

How?

But you said grey, sir.

Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --

Excellent.

We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.

First of all...

I don't have to...

Franco mother-fucking Harris!

They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.

And you're a little fucking reject.

You're a loser.

You go home!

You want to hear me out?

What are you talking about?

Why?

Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?

You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!

That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.

There's more.

You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?

Have you ever done this before?

What?

We've already done this.

Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.

I am not flexible on this.

We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.

At the seven-eleven.

They're on me. They're smoking me out!

They won't figure it out.

They're driving me nuts!

Later.

No...we want padded chairs...okay?

They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...

Don't eyeball your kids.

I know...

I got you.

Don't sweet lip me.

Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?

Where is she?

Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.

Not tonight.

Left side.

Give me two more.

That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.

No.

Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...

Shut up Boyd.

He's having a problem here.

What you just said. Say it again.

Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?

Suck my ass.

Yeah.

I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.

Israel doesn't have a King.

They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.

What's your point?

He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.

Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?

I don't think so.

Sent it.

Sent it.

I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.

How could I know what else I forgot?

Well it's bad timing.

I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.

Why? What's his problem?

He's weird. And I expect more from you.

It's vile!

So what do we do?

I'll call them from the road.

Of course.

Well I do.

I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.

No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.

Well, can you come back inside?

Now?

Are they fighting?

We're not canceling.

Micheal, by accident.

What does that mean?

Yeah, Dad. It's great.

Go for it.

I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...

Buzzing?

What is it?

A move?

I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.

Drum banging real times.

Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.

No, the children sleep with me.

No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.

You'd like me to kill them?

Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.

In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.

Who is she?

Nothing. I didn't say anything.

How could anybody behave like that?

Whatever you like.

Today I can refuse you nothing.

It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...

What's the matter?

I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...

The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.

He was asking for it.

Nothing.

If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...

Where's the dough?

That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.

I know that you used to work with an architect.

You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.

She's left.

No.

How much do you want for him?

I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!

He couldn't get through the door, then?

They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.

In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.

You are forgiven. Goodbye.

Oh, you slept well; don't worry.

Can you tell us what's on the disc?

Me? What did I do?

I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.

Madison lives two blocks from their present location.

I'm getting by.

If you can catch him.

What she's going to do is get in my way.

She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.

Any sign of Lindenmeyer?

I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?

We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.

Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.

Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.

If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.

Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?

I was assured the problem was corrected.

He hears...everything.

Do I get to see it or not?

You're...such a wimp.

What I need is a nymphomaniac.

It was me, what?

In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?

You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...

I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.

He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.

Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...

Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.

Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.

Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.

Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...

I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.

Stop me.

Nothing.

I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.

I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...

Thanks.

Sid?

Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...

Duck!

Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?

Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.

Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.

BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!

As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.

You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...

When you...  What?  I'm busy.

<u>Hello</u>.  What?

For Schumann.

I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,

Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...

All we have to do now is sell it to the President.

Wilfred, that's not bad.

Come on.

But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?

I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.

We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.

It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.

I'll see you at National.

What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.

Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.

Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....

Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?

A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...

<u>So</u> forth...

...Stanley Moss...

...fourteen years...

Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...

I'm doing my job, Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.

Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...

No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 

You gonna git me back tomorrow?  Cause they havin <u>beans</u> tomorrow...

ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.

...we own it?

Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...

Where is he?

Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...

N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?

I have.

I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.

...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.

Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...

...uh ... No, that's...

Why Albania?

Because.

In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...

Oh, he's gonna be Aces.

They got him standing by.

What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.  We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in... 

You do your job right, nobody should notice.

Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.

Might, if I was asked... 

We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.

Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.

It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the number...hello...hello...

He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...

They'll be here in ten minutes.

Watch me.

Keep Talking....

...what is this?

The Canada Thing was a shuck.  A <u>shuck</u> -- wasted a day. What can you do with Canada?  Bears, mapleleafs, "sugar -on-Snow."  Lays there on the plate like a lox.

He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.

Leopard Skin...

Isn't Johnny Green in the... 

Better.

Yes.

...they... <u>you</u> know...

I'm just talking about the Hats.

Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.

Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...

SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?

Sounds like a french word, what is it?

I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...

...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.

Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.

Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.

Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?

...gotta read my reports.

Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...

Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.

D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.

Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.

Not in here Dad... please. Later.

Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.

Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...

Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.

Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...

What'd you tell him?

Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.

Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.

Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.

Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...

Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?

All right, Bud... let's do it.

He never told me...

A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...

Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.

Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!

I remember that deal. You were involved?

Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?

But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.

How much?

Why do you need to wreck this company?

If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.

Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?

How much is enough Gordon?

Dump it.

Excuse me.

Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.

You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.

Yeah, almost...

The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.

...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 

That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...

You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...

I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.

At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.

Why?

Any better and I'd be guilty.

Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.

There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.

No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...

It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.

Now tell me, why would I want to do that?

Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.

You got it, G.G.

Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?

You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.

We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.

Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.

Businessman!

It's all rather morbid though isn't it?

Thank you

Thank you

Well divide 18 into three

Mom.

Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?

But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY

Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.

I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.

That's not true.

No.  But once I heard...

You're joking.

Try to communicate with her somehow.

I don't know, I'm very confused right now.

You were in an accident?

Almost.

No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.

Give me that shit.  Your wife.

It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--

That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.

I've never even met you.

And then you weren't there.

Of what?  What were you so afraid of?

No.  No, I don't.

Yeah.

Claire.

It's fine.

This is...

...just so she could cut them off.

She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.

What?

Shhh.

Jody, wait.

Did I?

No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.

No.

What are you going to do?

Like what?

We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.

Don't.

Three o'clock.

You are...

Yup.

More or less.

That's not what I'm sug--

I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.

What kind of whispering?

Really?

Wow.

Huh.

What's going on, Claire?

And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--

A flare?

Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?

Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.

Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...

Well, that's a relief.

We had a seance.

Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.

Maybe you resent how busy I've been.

Yep.

Are you glad?  I'm glad.

But I don't remember.

What's wrong with me?

Not personally.

Stop...

Since when?

Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.

Who?

STOP IT!

What?

...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.

Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.

Yep.  There's some great places nearby.

Don't think so.

IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!

:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.

Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.

Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.

You sound certifiable. Yon know that.

Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.

He made that quite clear, yes.

It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.

This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.

I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?

Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!

I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -

I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.

But have I...?  Ever...?!

I love Michael...

They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...

How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?

Rowan...

Like this...  LIKE THIS...?

Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...

I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...

I'm glad you're around to say it.

I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.

It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-

You still feel that crazy...?

It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?

Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?

Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -

Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?

He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!

Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.

It's not true.  You have to believe me.

Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.

If you like that type.

Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?

Sut McKinley.  Marry me.

Is that a crack about our singing...?

CHIC MAGAZINE?

Yes - I have had it for years.

I really don't know what to say

The touch?

And how many people have you killed?

Where do you kill them...

my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?

Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?

Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...

Nothing could be better...

I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...

Open it...

But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...

Out - I may be some time

LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think

No thanks - 

I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.

I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...

At home alone - where were you?

Get out...

No worries

And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...

Oh...

I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...

Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.

I'll be sure to...

Yes - one please.

You and your pep talks.

That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.

Were you always this sick?

You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.

Poor Freud, turning in his grave.

Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.

Yeah, whatever.

I better go, Dad.

Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.

Take a whiff of heaven.

Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.

No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.

I love those springy head puppies!

Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.

Let me get this straight...

God, I love being dead.

From your lips, to God's ears.

So you'll think about it?

I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.

Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.

Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...

I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.

It's my private business! Mine!

Dad, please.

Of course we are.

I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.

...not the pit.

We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.

You ordered a Winnebago?

Watch your tone, mister.

They're in the ignition, silly.

Whatever you want.

What do you want me to do?

You mean they knew who I was?

Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.

I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?

Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!

So, what brings you here at his hour?

You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.

Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.

Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.

Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.

It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.

In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.

That's not ENTIRELY true.

Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.

I know.

Well? Where the hell are you?

Amen to that.

My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.

You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.

That's hard to believe.

You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.

I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.

What is all this? When are you coming home?

Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.

Only the best for my mother.

Forget the store. Think big.

Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"

Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.

Of course I like girls.

Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.

Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!

I was like a different person tonight.

In other words, our scope is too narrow.

Really? So I'm doing OK?

Seriously? I'm doing all right?

You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.

--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!

I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?

Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.

I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.

Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.

She still work there?

And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.

I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.

Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?

That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?

I'd like that.

Ray thinks she was murdered.

Back to the land of grownups.

All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.

You're telling me you believe the guy?

You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.

Lombardo's settlement?

Unless what?

You have someplace to be?

Where's Lombardo?

So you were alone.

I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...

Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?

No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...

Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...

I would hardly say you look like trash.

I miss Dad.

Yes.  God, Mom...

I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.

I won't.

No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.

Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.

Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.

Do it to ourselves?

Why can't you come...

You know what it takes.

There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...

Okay.  I love you too.

That's not your line.

You think that's wise?

Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.

Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.

Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.

What's that supposed to mean?

Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...

That's right.

Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?

Will they?

Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?

Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?

Sit down, Lombardo.

Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.

That was the same thing Ray said.

Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.

We?

What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...

To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.

Is this leading somewhere?

Quite.  Come, let's mingle.

All what?

Hey, I tried the board.

What way is that?

"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."

Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.

Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.

You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.

This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.

Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.

Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!

Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.

Oh, I see, an easy plan!

What is this?  A whole new train?

My Lord, he was telling the truth!

They don't even realize they should be frightened.

Your guests, ma'am?

Well, I owe you one, don't I?

Private train?

This is Colonel Richards.

Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.

I deal with some tough customers.

Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?

That would be... the Mexican War?

Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?

Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?

Yes!

A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.

You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.

They're coming.

He thought you were a woman, Airk!

You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.

No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!

Not today, Willow.

If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?

No.  I mean yes.

I have no family.

Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.

As above, so below.

Good.  How long will it take?

You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.

Farmer.

Are you a warrior?

Friend of yours?

I hate this.

My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.

Who?

You're crazy.  I think you're in love.

Ahhh!

I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.

What do I need for that?

Shhhhh!

There's nobody here.

More!  More!

Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.

Shut up.

Who is that horrible friend of yours?

Guess I'm not used to so much.

John, why?...

I'll be all right. You just do as I say.

I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!

Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.

Sure have, Sam.

Maybe.

If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.

Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.

How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.

Johnny 

Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.

Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.

Yes. And I also want to leave this city.

Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.

Home.

The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.

Two days.

But you can't.

Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.

Something wrong with buttons?

Quaint? Can't imagine why.

I know what he said.

There was.

Where's my baggy pants?

Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch  I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.

Wrong.

I have committed no sin.

You are acting like one!

He's from... Ohio... My cousin.

Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.

No... No. It is just the English way.

They are English. They don't understand.

Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --

Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --

Yes, darling.

No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....

Oh, I hope we got them in time.

Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.

Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.

The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!

Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.

I don't believe you!

Oh ....

Ohhh!

Oh!

Hickory!

Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.

No, I'm afraid I didn't.

But, how do I start for Emerald City?

Toto, too.

Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.

Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.

Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?

Yes...That's Aunt Em.

Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.

Uh-huh.

Stop her!

Oh --!

Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!

Yes...!

Lions and tigers and bears!

Oh, come on.

It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.

Did they hurtcha?

Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.

I think I'll miss you most of all.

I have so got brains.

Ohhh --

They would?

Where's Kansas?

Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?

Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.

To Oz?

Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?

Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.

Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --

Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!

It's too late!  There they....

Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --

Who at?

Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!

This way!  Come on!

She - she can have my Witch Remover.

Hold still - hold still --

Yeah --

Oh, she bit her dog, eh?

Ohhhhhh!

Dorothy!

Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!

Well, I --

Help!

Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?

Dont know any doctor jokes.

Heres your imposter. Hes paid off the men on the plane outside.  Theyre not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyre flying it wherever he tells them.

Then its no longer a bomb?

Makes her look even more innocent.

She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Ms life is part of the bet.

We go down to the torpedo bay.

Like riding a bike.

But what if...

Shes not a girl anymore.

The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.

Who?

Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?

The inside man?

Who did you get it from?

You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...

Havent you heard the news?  So is she.

You knew him well?

Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?

Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.

You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.

Youre not going to.

I know.

Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?

Shush.

A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?

You can drop the act, its over.

I think you do.

You turned Renard.

He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.

Oh James.

Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...

But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.

She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?

And the payoff on the tables?

This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!

The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.

Yes.  Au revoir...

And expensive.  Cost three million plus.

Its heading for the oil terminal.

Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.

The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.

Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.

Wrong answers?

Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.

God isn't there to do it.

Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --

Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.

That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.

Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.

I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!

My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?

You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.

I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?

Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.

Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .

Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.

Maybe not, but why take chances?

No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.

His . . . whatever.

Memory lane.

Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.

Okay!

The costumes.  Am I right?

Yes you are.

Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?

Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.

Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.

Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --

We should get back --  What?

Did you know he was back on the streets?

What does this mean?  What does it --

That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --

I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.

I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.

Maybe I'll do that.

Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.

No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.

I'm not interested. I've already got a job.

There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.

What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.

Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.

Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?

They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.

I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.

You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.

I've seen enough. Turn it off.

So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.

Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?

Naturally.

Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.

I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.

Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.

I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?

So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?

They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.

No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.

I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.

I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.

We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.

It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.

Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.

We'll have to go after them.

A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.

You don't have to do that.

A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.

Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!

It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.

Nice place to start, don't you think?

Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.

I'm through, Xander.

Here we go again.

Yeah, thanks a lot.

You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?

Is this what you're looking for?

He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.

Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.

Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.

That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.

How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?

It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.

We all do.

Beast.

His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.

Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.

It's too far.

I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?

Some cigars.  Case of beer.

By reading my thoughts?

He's busy right now.

What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?

Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --

Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.

Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.

Let's just say, God works too slowly.

To find Rogue.

I'll go.

They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?

ALIVE.

Not at the cost of lives, Max.

Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.

I know.

He is the fifth leading authority in his field.

You have the wrong house.

From your office, sir.

Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.

Yes, sir?

MMmmm.

Well... yes.

I...

Goodbye, darling!

Darling!

You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.

Is it worth taking a chance?

May I have it, please?

Will there be anything else?

I beg your pardon?

Dr. Fronkonsteen!

How old are you, young man?

Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.

But your grandfather's work, sir...

It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.

Yes, just the two.

What wockers?

Just putting up some tea.

Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.

Can you imagine that brain in this body?

All right... elevate me!

What?

Wait till he sees the bill.

You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.

Who are you talking to?

You're just supposed to repeat what you said.

What did you find out?

How do you know it was a 'she'?

Can you play it?

That's what we're paid for.

MMMmmmmmmmm.

Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.

...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................

Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??

Ja, ja.

Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.

That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?

Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.

Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.

Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...

I thought it was wonderful.

Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...

Stop -- singing!!!

What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.

I see what you mean.

I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.

No.  Nor to Elizabeth.

Yes, Elizabeth has hers.

...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

Four

Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.

Do Something!  Stall them!

Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.

Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.

I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.

My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.

Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".

Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.

Right.  Bombardier, to me please.

Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.

Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
