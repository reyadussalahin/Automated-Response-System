She's not a...

So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?

Hi.

You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?

So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.

You are so completely unbalanced.

Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --

He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.

But

I just wanted --

What if she never starts dating?

No, but

I'm missing something.

Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?

Why not?

Guess who just signed up for a tutor?

What makes you think he'll do it?

You got him involved?

Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.

What's the worst?

You need money to take a girl out

You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.

I just upped my price

But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?

That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.

He always look so

The people at this school are so incredibly foul.

What'd he say?

You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.

Have you seen him?

You hate me don't you?

Excuse me?

You're not okay.

I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.

I thought you were above all that

I heard there was a poetry reading.

You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?

You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?

No, I won't go with you

Wait I...

I know.

As a parent, that's my right

Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.

Tempestuous?

Cool pictures.  You a fan?

Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?

Ever been to Club Skunk?

I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.

So you got cozy with she who stings?

Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?

You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?

What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap

He's the devil's child...

Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?

I haven't given you much of a life.

Are we going to argue?

They took everything...

I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?

How far from here?

Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?

Father...

You seem to have a special talent for making friends.

I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.

Chief says -- how many?

To bring the word of God.

We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?

God... That's in a week!

How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.

You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!

You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.

If God intends you to go, then you will go.

May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!

There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?

We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.

In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!

We're lost!

Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?

... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...

Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.

Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.

But it's...

I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.

Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.

Your mother was blind?

Out on my back when I was a small boy.

...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.

What about back home?

I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.

I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.

You better get packed.

Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?

Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.

How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.

Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.

Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?

Any I.D.?

I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...

Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.

Mind if I ride along with you?

I'll let you know what happens.

So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.

Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?

What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid

I don't have a girlfriend.

I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.

But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.

I kill someone famous.

Is it drug related?

Detective - can you tell us what happened here?

I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?

Alright.

Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.

Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?

Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?

Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.

Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!

Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.

Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.

Okay, til tonight.

Are you married?

C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.

It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?

Next.  Could I see your documents, please?

Please join us.  Come on forward.

Did you hear what I said?

Whore?

Get in the bathroom!

Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!

Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?

I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.

Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!

I can get you a job.

Isn't he a little moody?

I'm trying to tell you.

Yes...he's my friend.

I speak English.

I'll send a cop back for you.

How did you start the fire this time?

Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!

How was it?

Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.

How?

Well, that's something.

I guess not.

The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.

Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.

Well, don't worry about it.

I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.

Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.

CONTINUED

CONTINUED

Are you coming to my party?

I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.

Oh, that's such a delightful age.

Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.

Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.

Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.

Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?

Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon

Any ideas about the colour?

Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.

Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.

Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?

That's true.

Hal, have pod arms secure the component.

Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?

Yeah?

Now how's your memory doin'?

Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.

Pay money?

Hey, what kind of talk is that?

No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.

Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?

What's the matter with my place?

Well, maybe I'll see you later ...

Yeah?

You're crazy.

We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...

Yeah.

I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.

We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.

I don't give out the details.

Last night.

Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.

Well?

That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.

You made that move, huh?

This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.

You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.

Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?

You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.

Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?

Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...

You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.

What about Luther?

Why?

Notice something funny about that bus?

It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.

That's right. Not my style, Reggie..

Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.

What the bell happened?

How did they get away?

He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.

Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.

Who are all these?

Doesn't look like it.

I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.

He ... he wants me to help him skip town.

Hey, you're right.

Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?

Call me later.

Thanks for the coffee.

Great place for lunch.

Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...

No wonder you're so popular.

Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...

What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?

I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.

You're impossible...

Who the hell are you?

Stall.

We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?

Surprise, Luther.

How you doing, man?

How about some ammo?

How much?

Don't mess with me. How much?

Appipulai Leeloo Minai..

Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!

...We're saved!

Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!

We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..

We have to save the world.

What are you doing?

You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.

Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?

Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.

We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.

Is there anything that can stop it?

What are we going to do?

There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...

They really made her...

I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.

Uh... at least fifty.

Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?

Hello?

...Ma???

Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...

I'm sorry..

6... 5...

...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?

Don't you open your messages?

You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?

Here we go again...

You noticed..

I'm so very sad.

...Like love...

Tell me...

How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!

This is all that survived?

Have you identified it?

Sounds like a freak of nature to me.

They just landed in the desert.

Is that better?

Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?

How's that? Can you hear me better now?

How's our deal coming along?

How's the detective business?

You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?

I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there

You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.

You should have.

She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...

Anything harder?

What are you talking about?

I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.

And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.

Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.

... sorry...

There are reasons for the way we do things here.

Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.

I figured you share information.

This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.

Who is Machine?

So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.

I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!

I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.

What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...

Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.

I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.

You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.

That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?

Except, you're willing commit murder with them.

You're asking me why?

Remember me?

I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.

What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?

Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...

Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.

How much do you make now?

... Hello... ?

You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.

There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.

I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?

What about me?

Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.

You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.

What's next?

Mister Welles. You're very prompt.

Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?

My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.

It's a film... of a girl being murdered.

If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...

Nothing remotely like this.

I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.

She just seemed... depressed... ?

What was she running from?

You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?

I didn't mean to...

It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...

You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?

He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...

Yes... I remember Mary

Do you know what happened to her?

Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...

Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.

Kincaid and Joey died last night.

I can't go back to sleep again.

No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.

You what?

You in a hurry?

You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.

I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.

I'm sorry honey, but...

Something wrong with the stairs?

What?

We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.

Hi, beautiful.

You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.

How was the meeting?

No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.

Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?

Are you alright?

You think that's the place she's buried?

You do good work, Alice.

I thought about that.

Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.

Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?

Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!

He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.

All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...

Stop saying that, it's bullshit.

I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!

You, too?

You could train someone else.

My father!  He's not - ?

Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -

At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -

So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'

But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.

Wonder where Powell and Carney are?

Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.

Is there any way out of it?

What about down?

A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!

Skipper - could you take a look here...?

The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.

Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...

We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?

I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.

But - what can we accomplish?

A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....

Always has been.

Who?

I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.

I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.

No.

The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --

LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?

You see it?

You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.

Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.

Mmm.

Drafted by the Red Sox.

Double A. New Britain.

This way.

Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.

No brag. Just fact.

I thought I told you to move that truck!

Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --

Bastard's got his high beams on.

No, I mean whereabouts.

On your sleeve.

I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?

Saw him do it?

Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.

I'm fucking out of here.

Open the door. We're late.

I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.

Yeah. It's stupid.

Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.

It's fun.

How about a Big Mac?

What do you want, then?

That's illegal, you know.

You don't want the extra police pay?

Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?

Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?

How you holding up, Wade?

Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.

He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.

You? Why?

Lillian!

You ever come to your father's grave anymore?

Did you get his number?

Good. Who?

I still don't understand --

New hat?  Jill's up, I see.

...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.

Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.

Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.

I can see what you looked like as a kid.

Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?

Going somewhere, Margie?

Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.

You're not using it today?

Coffee's perked.

Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.

He's asleep. We were up very late.

Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.

It don't look right.

I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.

You talked to Jack?

Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?

You remember Margie Fogg?

Yeah.

Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?

Pop, for Christ's sake!

Rolfe.

Who?

I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.

Motive. You gotta have a motive.

I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.

It may have happened, but not the way you said.

To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?

You don't want to say hi to your father?

I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.

You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.

Daddy. Daddy, please...

You're one of Stravanavitch's men.

Oooooh, I'm good.

Daddy...

The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.

Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.

They aren't answering their hails.

The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.

If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.

We've already been inspected.

The rest of the secret service?

Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.

This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.

Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.

Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.

*                     Please tell me your name.

I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.

Now, or he dies, please.

Leave my daughter alone.

Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.

Stop.

There goes your ride.

No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.

Twenty minutes?

Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?

May I speak to you for a moment?

Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.

How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.

What are you doing?

The fax machines.

White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.

*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.

You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.

That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.

Kruger, Sagittarius.

What are you doing, Ted?

Ted.

Elaine, we have to go back.

Elaine, what's going on?

Ted, we've only got ten minutes.

What will happen to him, Ted?

Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.

Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.

Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.

Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.

Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.

My career is shot.

Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.

That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.

Can I say something of a personal nature to you?

Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.

I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.

He's a boy dog.

Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.

That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.

Which passenger is Joe Salucci?

Whenever your're ready, Captain.

It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.

I have to see Bud Kruger.

Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!

You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.

You've been hurt.

No.  I mean your relationship.

Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.

Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?

Captain, how soon can we land?

What is it, Doctor? What's happening?

You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.

I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.

It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.

Ted, what are you doing here?

Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.

I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!

But Ted, you're the only...

See them, Elaine?

We have a visitor.

Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.

Good-bye, darling.

You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!

I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.

Yes?

We have clearance, Clarence.

Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?

No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.

There's a little girl on board who's ill and...

Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.

Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?

Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.

Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.

I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?

You okay?

We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--

What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.

Let's talk Hubley.

Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?

Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--

A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.

A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.

Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?

Back off, George.

Screw you.

Tell me.

I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?

And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.

So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?

I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.

How potent?

We?  You've taken it?



Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.

Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.

That where Anderson worked?

Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.

No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.

You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?

You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.

Granger and Pitts are already on it.

Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.

Movement!

Can't lock up...

And it's too late to shut it down?

Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...

Is she...?

Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.

It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.

No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.

What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.

Now, wait a second --

These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?

Where are your parents?  You have to try...

I told them to fall back...

All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...

Sir, the CPU is on-line.

Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.

Let's go!  Let's go!

All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.

Now many?

Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?

It's inside the complex.

Sounds like you, Hicks.

I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.

Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.

There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.

And how are we today?

Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.

Cross my heart.

Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.

Yes, there are, aren't there.

I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.

No, it's different, honey.

Yes.  A little girl.

Can we dream?

Look, I told you...

Why won't you check out LV-426?

Maestro.

And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?

Oh!

What does he look like?

Did you know? Had you heard?

In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!

Stop it!

No! No! No!

Why not?

Yes, you are. You're very sick.

No, I'm not playing this game.

Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.

One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!

How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?

Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.

What's the matter with you?

May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?

Wolfi!

This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?

Give me one reason I can understand.

Some service deserves service in return. No?

It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.

Why you?

Where's our friend?

I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!

I see that you're expecting.

Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.

Upstairs.

Just one year.

Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?

Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.

An interesting idea, Majesty. But -

You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.

Do you like this, Salieri?

So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?

Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?

It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?

Would you tell me why?

But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.

Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.

Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?

Yes, what about him?

Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.

It couldn't be better.

Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!

What's that?

Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!

Father -

Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.

Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.

I think I've found out about the money, sir.

Is he working?

Yes?

Well?

Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?

Of course! What else do you think they speak here?

Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?

Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.

Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.

I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.

No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.

Ah. Italian?

I can't say. Really

Where is your wife?

No, please.

Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.

I do.

What?

Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?

Would you? Actually, you could.

You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.

Where did I stop?

Do you believe in it?

Confutatis Maledictis.

The Fire.

With the tenors.

Do you have me?

That's wonderful!

We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.

That will do, Herr Mozart!

Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.

Can we see the scene with the music back, please?

They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.

Herr Mozart -

So?

Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?

I do not seek forgiveness.

Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.

Do you hear me?

All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!

Where?

Bravo, Your Majesty!

Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.

I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.

That lady is back, sir.

Herr Salieri.

Can I be of service, Miss Price?

Did he say a wolf?

It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.

It's a full moon. Where is he?

He's not?

Yes.

David says Jack comes to warn him.

Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?

You've absolutely no idea where David might be?

Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.

Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?

Let's try a little harder, shall we?

My best friend. My very best friend.

All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?

Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?

Anything.

I've left those pills for you.

David! Where on earth have you been!?!

But...

David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.

We had an argument. He's being silly.

Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...

Hello, Benjamin.

No what?

Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.

No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!

I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.

Miss Price! Miss Price, please!

There were witnesses?

How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.

No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.

Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.

Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?

I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.

Ask them what the candles are for.

Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.

What do you think was wrong?

Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.

Say, David...

Shit! David, what is that?

Nice doggie. Good boy.

It sounds far away.

I'm not listening!

A monster. I know, I know.

I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.

What can I say, Jack?

Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?

Excuse me.  Yes?

Sorry, love.

Remember the Alamo?

Sorry.

Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...

Hello, Tom.

What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!

Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest

No kidding?

Where's Matt?

When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.

Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything

I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.

Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.

I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!

You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?

She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't

You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?

But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?

This won't do. Not during business hours . . .

For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .

Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks

Doesn't that come next?

But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.

I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.

No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.

Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.

Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.

Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?

Why - well, I

Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.

You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?

Good morning, Helen.

Yes?

I already told him I was home.

No. I won't.

You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?

Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?

Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is

I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!

All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?

You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.

They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.

No.

Yes.

Yes.

Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?

What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.

In Cluett's office?

Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.

Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.

What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?

What did you find out, Mike?

Never mind all that. What did you find out?

Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?

Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...

No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.

What time did you get in?

This is the best score yet.

Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.

I swear --

Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."

Yesterday.

Corn gonna shoot at me?

"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."

Beg pardon?

Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...

You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?

Thanks for the help.

I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.

I got seven thousand.

It's not a bank.

Jesse, we got to have a word.

Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.

Beautiful.

And almost got hanged in peacetime.

WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!

You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --

Where'd you get all these riders?

BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!

The safe. Now.

Then why can't I go in there?

Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.

Where the hell were you?

Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.

You are a charmer.

Pinkertons. It's the railroad.

... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.

You've killed your fair share of men.

We're doing this for Ma.

We're drunk.

He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?

A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?

I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.

...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.

That he was.

Easterners.

Riders --

But still died.

Jesse, are you awake?

Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."

Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?

Zee.

I don't understand.

Hmm.

Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?

Aw, shucks, ma'am...

Don't turn around.

Tennessee?

Did you order our houses burned down?

Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.

This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.

The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?

What about that Rock Island bastard?

Oh, you were talking to Jesse.

Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.

Well, this land is about to be condemned.

My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.

Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.

Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.

Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.

You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.

To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.

The final route for the railroad is complete.

This is him.

It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.

Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.

There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.

I can't.

Pick me up?

A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 

Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.

Are we here?

Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.

Pull out.

Oh Jesus. I'm going home.

Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!

That's nice.

Do you want to come to my apartment or not?

Yes, darling?

He's rich.

Are you using minoxidil?

Your hairline looks like it's receding.

It's over, Evelyn. It's all over

But what about the past? Our past?

No, no, no.

Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?

Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.

It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?

Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.

This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?

What's that, a gram?

I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.

Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.

Dorsia.

Oh? And what should I say?

I'll do it.

Tell him I'm at lunch.

That is...if you're not doing anything.

Anywhere you want?

Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.

Interesting.

Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.

Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.

Jean? What?

Where are you?

Patrick? I can't hear you.

Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.

Yeah.

Who?

Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.

Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL

Perrier? San Pellegrino?

KIMBALL.

Well, what's the topic of discussion?

Understandable.  Lime?

How old are you?

Where did you go to school?

Your address?

You sure?

Do you feel that way?

Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...

Had his apartment been burglarized?

That's so typical, isn't it?

How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 

I mean they want to get caught.

Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?

I've questioned him.

He does? You're sure?

Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 

Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?

You're not what? Qualified for anything else?

Speak up. Come on.

Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.

Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.

Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?

Really? That's interesting.  Not great?

Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.

Hey, Halberstam?

I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?

I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.

A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --

I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.

C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --

That took some fun out of --

He's your boss. He's not your --

If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.

What're you -- what?

Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.

How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.

They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.

I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.

After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.

If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.

You look beautiful.

What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.

If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.

Well I parked illegally. See y'later?

This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.

What?!

What?!

There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.

Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.

Who's that?

How's it going?

Milo. What's up?

Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.

I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.

What'd the girl say?

Gary?

All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.

Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?

What're we looking for?

Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.

You calling Phil and Randy?

Did you wanna be alone?

Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.

He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.

How close are you?

It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.

I don't know --

Meet me at the other location.

...He knows.

Latitude 47 degrees.

But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.

Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.

Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.

What is it?

That kid's the great white hope.

Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.

In Japan, men come first and women come second.

'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'

Where am I?

WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

When do I begin?

Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.

Oh, and Austin...

Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.

Oh, and Austin...

Yes?

Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.

My God, Austin, what have you done?

All right, Austin, I think you should go.

Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.

"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.

Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...

Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?

Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?

My meat and two veg.

We can't just sit here, Austin.

Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.

Fancy a nibble?

Why?

Oh, yes you are.

Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.

Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?

Not a good time to lose one's head.

That's not the way to get ahead in life.

I love you, Austin.

One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.

Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.

Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?

What is it now?

But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?

An evil vet?

In due time.

I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.

Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!

Umm, that also has already happened.

Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?

What about his teeth?

I just don't see it.

Red ...

Secret ...

He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.

You

Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?

Quite a collection.

Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...

How curious ...

Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?

Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.

Who?

The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.

Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...

That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...

Choices?

Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.

Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.

I didn't. Mother did.

Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.

Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?

According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...

So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?

That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.

Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?

For you, Mrs. Peel.

Is that what you think?

To kill me?

I could save you the trouble.

I told Mother I took care of you.

His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.

I'll be back ...

'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'

A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...

Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.

Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...

Makes two of us.

I was getting to it.

The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --

Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'

Amnesia?

I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.

Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.

Wonderland Weather Ltd.

Mrs. Peel -- ?

Let it be rain, please let it be --

John Steed.

What's happening?

Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.

Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.

You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?

I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.

All right!

Cole...

Seventy-five hundred.

Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...

I'm ready to make you another deal.

Low mileage... Handles like a dream.

He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.

Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?

Nice shot.

So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?

Cole, we've got to talk.

Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...

You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.

That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.

Stop fooling around... I need to talk.

I don't know... I just feel scared.

Have a good time. Don't make it too late.

Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.

Are you okay?

Why is Cole here?

Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.

That's it, prick lips.

Let's go.

Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?

Gary, how we doing, big stallion?

I'm telling you I am, Joe.

My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.

Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.

What the hell are you doing?

Mr. Thomerson, I...

The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.

I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?

I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?

Right in there, pal.

Who was that?

Now, don't get into any trouble.

Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.

You're late again, Rick.

There can be no excuse for tardiness.

Biggest in two battalions.

Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...

Is he...

You gotta let me finish --

There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.

What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.

How do you know?

Anything else?

I'll handle it.

You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?

Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...

Huh.

You think that's really any of your business?

No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.

When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.

I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --

I don't know anything about it.

I think your boss is going to need some spin control.

What'll you do?

I'll see ya around, huh?

Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?

Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?

If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --

I need another one, sir.

No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.

-- Shhh.

Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.

That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!

Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.

Did I say thanks?

So what do you want me to do?

Brian?

'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?

Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.

Every little boy's fantasy.

Mr. McCaffrey...

Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?

Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".

So, you surviving without me?

"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?

I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.

You can't talk about my brother like that...

What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?

Yeah? When was the last time?

See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.

-- Burn them.

Got a cause?

It knows us. This one knows us.

Inspector.

People.

Yeah.

You took the chalice.

How are you doing, man?

I forgive you.

I forgive you.

I forgive you.

Oh, really?

You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --

How's the case going?

The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?

Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.

I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?

Well you did.

If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?

Yeah, him.

What do you do?

I'm not smiling.

You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.

Please, have a seat.

So that's what you been doing?

You're in this up till ya neck.

Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.

If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?

That ain't funny.

How different?

You're now Mantan.

Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?

...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.

Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?

I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.

I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.

That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.

I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.

That's a great handle.

Negroes would be in an uproar.

I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.

Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?

Hold on a sec, I got a call.

Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.

That's what I'm askin'.

Dem white boys giving you a hard time?

I love you too, Daddy.

So what's up with you?

How was it?

Nobody told me anything.

Manray!

I'm in till the end.

Hello.

Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.

You've said that already.

Same here.

What is this?

Is that good or bad?

No joke.  Serious.

You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?

You must think I'm some kind of fool.

How's the food?

I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?

Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.

He wants you to come and see him.

Regardless, he still is your father.

Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.

Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?

Where are you from?

Finland.

Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?

I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.

Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.

No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?

Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?

...yes she did.

Around...

I fell out of my bed last night.

Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?

People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.

I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.

Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.

How did you get this gig?

Stop playing me Sloan.

So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.

And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --

Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.

O'Grady.

You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.

That's a very handsome sword you have there.

Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?

Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?

Where is my rascal, Lazlo?

For whom else have you worked?

But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?

Then you yield to me.

Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.

Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.

It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.

The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.

You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?

Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.

My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:

I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.

What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?

Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?

I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?

All the same, you must name an amount.

Was he cheated?

Then this must be done tomorrow.

What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?

But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?

As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?

How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.

I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.

There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.

Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.

Yes, he's fine.

I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.

Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.

Don't you ever point a gun at me!

A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?

You killed him you fucking faggot --

We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?

Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?

You too?

You smoke, Ray?

Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!

Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.

And he'd been shot.

Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --

We're not finished yet --

Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --

Where?

Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.

Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?

What do you mean, West's?

You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.

We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --

Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.

There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --

I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.

He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?

He admitted it.

Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.

You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!

The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.

You think you could explain all this to me?

I'm sorry, Bill.

You're a good soldier, Bill.

You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.

I didn't mean that as a compliment.

Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.

He's in interrogation?

I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.

You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?

He's telling the truth, up to a point.

Something wrong?

But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --

Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.

Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --

Buttfucks the cabin?

What?

Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?

Four --

We need to talk --

You're a good man, Hardy.

Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.

Nah.

A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.

You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?

They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --

We just want --

No one else heard it?

Nunez was chasing Dunbar.

Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?

It won't work --

Thank God...

You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --

Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --

This is totally unnecessary --

But this guy you called, he's not even Army --

You want Kendall, don't you?

Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!

I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.

I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.

Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.

Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.

Then do it.

Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?

Did you see that woman?

It's okay, just leave it.

Lord, I'm sorry I...

Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.

Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?

There was one time when I was eleven...

Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.

Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?

Jesus Christ.

You --  -- are in for a surprise.

Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...

No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.

I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.

Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?

What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?

I'm sorry.

How did you get so many?

You don't even know me.

So what are you up to now?

Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.

Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.

I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.

I'm going to get started on dishes.

I need you on my side.

Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.

How is he?

What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?

Josephine and I have a lot in common.

I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.

The sets were good.

It's enough isn't it?

You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.

You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.

Right.

So?

What was that?

So. Is it different to how you imagined it?

I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?

I don't understand.

In the world.

I'm going to be sick. Where's the...

You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.

What?

What?

And who says what is wrong.

Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.

So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?

Sometimes which?

I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.

You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.

What happened between you and the blonde?

Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?

She's alive!! She is not dead?

You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.

Nobody's that unhappy.

I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?

Whatever.

My name's Sophia.

Angela?

I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.

Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.

This was very sweet of you.

Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...

Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.

Mind I ask, what's all this business here?

Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.

What happened?

It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.

Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.

Think this about money still, ya old fool?

I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.

Laz... You can't say nothin'...

My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.

GODDAMMIT, RAE!

SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

Take it easy now. Don't rush it.

Gal, you ain't right yet.

Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!

No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.

I said... STOP!

My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!

Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...

Still makin' jokes?

My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.

Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.

Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.

That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...

Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.

It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.

You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?

Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.

Heard about this morning.

You a preacher?

Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.

It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.

I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.

I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.

Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.

I feel better. Do you?

Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!

Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.

I think she got to you, pappy.

Back-up.

... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --

Who do you think the Jap is?

Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?

What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.

I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.

I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.

... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.

Getting very weird.

It's incredible.  Hit him or something.

... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!

What's he saying?

Nick --

Because he knows how to get to our man.

Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.

You did great, Ichiro.

You know, Nick, we can't lose.

Ich said you left.

An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.

She ever pull down her shades?

They want your autograph.

Can't make you change your mind?

Might be different in New York.

Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.

How big a package we talking about?

Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.

How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.

... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.

I want a gun.

Could you fill me in?

Because I want you to tell me.

Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!

You had my help, detective.

-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.

Why tell me this?

With these?

What's the point?

Also you're too valuable to experiment with.

Show me something?

We have a lot in common.

You could help us.

Yeah.

Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

Vodka!

You want to see my friends?

Those cockroaches?

Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.

During the road test...

You're going to be over the limit.

You sure?

Why didn't you go?

Who?

Book the good ones for where?

There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.

Jeezus!

I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.

In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.

Is there anything else?

Two of us might be more effective than one.

You use your equipment, don't you?

Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.

What do people do in the afternoon?

Did you cry when your father died?

I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.

Have you ever cleaned your apartment?

Uh-huh.

Do you think I simulated what happened between us?

Where the hell you been?

Have you ever retired a human by mistake?

How many questions did it take?

She didn't know?

How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?

I kinda get nervous when I take tests.

Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...

I'm hungry, J.F.

My glands.  They grow old too fast.

Let's go talk first, Adam.

Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.

No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.

Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?

I came on a bus.

And that's it?

It's Perry!

Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!

How's that?

I can't, it's yours.

Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.

I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!

Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?

Watching television in color.

Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.

Two weeks.

You got it! Wait here while I change.

Very funny, smart ass.

Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.

I don't want to be alone.

Bites what?

It does?

I didn't know that.

They're all divorced?

It didn't used to be that way.

When do you need her by?

Never drive again!

I was wrong!!

Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?

Where's he gone?

May I please be excused?

About clothing?

Hey, Eve!

What about her?

Why?!  I think she's very attractive.

Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.

Why are you suddenly so mad at me?

I'm really sorry!

Eve, if you'll let me, I can --

There.

That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?

Really?  Okay!

Are you all right?

I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?

You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!

En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!

These are wonderful.

What's baseball?

Like a painting?

The nocturnal flying mammal?

Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...

...the pipe tobacco.

Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.

One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.

Right on the button.

That's right?

When did we get it from them?

Yes. He likes windows.

Not on him.

That's why little things mean so much to him.

Why did you park way back there?

No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.

Good-bye, Adam.

Bye, Troy!

You dial nine to get out.

Twenty-five? Around there.

Up here on the fifteenth floor?

Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.

Oh. A nice one, I hope.

Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.

We have to go.

Oh, my God!

According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.

You got a light, honey?

I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!

Home sweet home!

The locks?

Maybe I've just got the creeps.

No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!

I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.

Yes.

No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!

And the ocean!  A mountain range!

He's smart.

You came back for these?

Give me your hand.

What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?

What do you want to do with it?

Yeah! That's thinking.

We came back to the house!

Frank. Come in.

Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?

Anything you can tell me?

What is this? What color is it?

Jeffrey! Come on in.

Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?

Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.

That oughta do it.

What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?

The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.

NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.

Thank you. honey.

You can hit me, if you want to.

No.

No. What is happening?

Hi, can I come in?

Falling.

Who is Don?

Yes.

Yes. Frank--

Do you like my body?

Shut up.

Come on Dorothy.

Dorothy. No!

Oh no.

They hurt his head.

Bull.

Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.

Hello, baby.

Hey? You like to walk.

What are you lookin' at?

Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.

I mean, for good, Jeffrey.

Where's all your things, Jeffrey?

What time are visiting hours?

Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.

Well.

No, you're right.

Hi Dad.

I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.

I guess you have to get back home soon?

I guess I'll see you sometime.

I don't want to cause any trouble.

It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.

Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.

Are you alright?

Yes. I do.

You really want to do this, don't you?

I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.

I'm going to wait here until she comes.

Did you see her undressed?

Who, me? Why should it?

I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.

Can I give you a kiss good night?

You were late.

Jeffrey? Why?

You worry about me really?

Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.

It's good to see you.

Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?

You want to dance?

Sandy?

Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.

Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.

I don't know why we have to watch TV.

Come on out a minute, okay?

Fuck you.

There's ways around that.

Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.

Are ya ready?

Yes sir.

Look under the body.

What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!

Anybody you think is evil?

Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?

What?

You think they sold me out? No way.

Anybody see ya?

What? What is it?

They got nothing.

I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.

How's Uncle Sibeal?

Still bickerin' over that, huh?

You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?

We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.

me up the...

Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?

Nervous?

Oh, we're good man.

Nine bodies.

Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.

So what do you think?

We've teamed up with a sex offender.

Now, you will receive us.

Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.

Maybe the three of them had something in common.

The shooter knew these guys, huh?

Who the...

Chief, what the fuck is this?

While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?

After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?

They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.

Hello?

Hurry the fuck up!

Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!

Liberating isn't it?

Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.

You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.

Worst day of my life, man.

Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.

Yes.

I want to stand for what I believe in, father.

Yes.

The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.

You gonna do what I say, got it?

I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!

Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.

The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.

I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.

Making Hutch David Soul?

Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.

That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.

I don't think so. Just reach on in.

Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!

What about what that guy said?

Yeah.

Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.

Can I get that credit card from you?

What about them?

That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.

Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.

Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?

They don't?

But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.

If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?

I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.

Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --

She doesn't need to know.

Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.

Yes, I do. Bob taught me.

I'm not. But there's --

I had to give some to Inez.

You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?

A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!

What exactly is this place? Freezers?

What time did he say to be here?

He doesn't want to fight.

No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.

Shit, Dignan.

OK. Mark that down.

Or I might end up with a broken nose.

I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.

Uh-huh?

I'm in position, Scarecrow.

I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --

Help me move him.

What are you doing?

Come on.

There's not enough time.

You think Applejack knew?

Why?

You're living on a sailboat?

Does it float?

So how is it in there? 

I think I may have found a way out of here.

Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:

That's a sharp jacket.

It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.

You mean like techniques?

Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?

How does that feel?

I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?

Exactly. Woah.

The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?

Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.

We're renegades from despair.

Future Man.

Could you grow cinnamon?

You'll probably have them the rest of your life.

Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.

You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.

I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.

I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.

Were you adopted, Bob?

Give him a second.

No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?

Yeah.

Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?

That's Anthony.

They are.

Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.

Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.

I think we might of scared her.

Bob.

You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.

What are you doing?

Way to go, Bob!

Bob, that makes no sense.

Give me the keys, Dignan.

Yes, I do.

Right. It was extremely stupid.

I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?

You said 48 hours!

Come on, Bob.

Everything OK?

Is he breathing?

The elevator broke.

Hold on --

And what does that cover?

You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?

We're closed, sir.

Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?

You a good pool player.

What?

No. Just pool.

How's the weather down there?

Come on in!

John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.

Well, we'll see you later, Bob.

I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.

That's not gonna fly.

I want to know what happened.

So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...

Excuse me.

My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.

Sit down.

I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.

Why not? It was just money.

I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.

Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]

It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?

You still should've moved.

You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.

No... How?

Where --

You drive.

-- it's just him? --

I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.

I love you, too.

How do they know that? How can they know any of that?

And you got to him before we could.

You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!

Abbott?

For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?

My first job.

It's me.

Okay, how do you want to do it?

There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --

-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --

Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?

You're sure?

How long have you worked for the agency?

I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??

What kind of problems?

Believed what?

I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.

What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.

Peace?!

With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!

Young Robert, we are honored --

A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.

The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.

Longshanks promised!

His legend grows! It will be worse than before!

The little cow is insane --

I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.

We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.

Stephen ready?

You know it's a trap.

Wanna stay with me tonight?

I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.

You'll move

My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.

Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.

No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.

Your father doesn't like me, does he?

I want... to marry you!

But I won't give you up to any nobleman.

I've missed you.

Tonight then.

Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.

Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?

What's the crazy man saying, Lord?

And you say he doesn't remember any of it?

Anything.

Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...

Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.

No dances, just tell me.

We're gonna be late again.

Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.

That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.

What happened?

Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?

I don't know... I don't remember.

...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.

Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?

You're. Acting. Like your father.

Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.

Are you hurting her?

It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.

Books?

Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.

I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --

Oh God... what did we do?

I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.

Ouch.

Not since we were kids.

No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.

Not if you remember my dad.

Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.

Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.

I don't understand, where are you taking me?

Why are you doing all this for me?

Are you okay?

I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...

Because you're... different.

Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.

You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.

Oh? There's proof now?

There's one major hole in your story.

I was?

I don't get it.

What's happened to -- How are you doing that?

Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.

You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.

And you are...?

It didn't feel like a dream.

You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!

What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.

Hey, what'd you do that for?

Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!

What the hell are you doing?

I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.

Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.

Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.

What did I say about mentioning that bitch?

The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.

Monsieur Rick?

How did you get in here? You're under age.

No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?

He did. Captain Renault did.

You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?

Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.

I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --

I'd better be going.

Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.

You haven't heard my offer.

Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.

That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.

Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?

Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.

Do you know where they are?

Rick?

It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.

Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

A franc for your thoughts.

That's easy. There was. He's dead.

My German's a little rusty.

With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.

Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?

Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.

Can I tell you a story, Rick?

I don't know the finish yet.

It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.

Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?

How did you get in?

Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?

Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --

-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.

Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.

I don't understand. What about you?

Yes.

Where is Rick?

When will he be back?

Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?

Did he give any reason?

Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.

Yes.

Hello, Rick.

And I congratulate you.

Good evening.

I beg your pardon?

Had a close one, eh?

No. It's all arranged.

Everything in order?

No, Captain, please.

My bill.

I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?

That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.

And the honor of having served the Third Reich.

I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.

Is that all you wish to tell us?

You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.

As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.

Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.

What is the meaning of that phone call?

My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.

How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.

It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.

Manages what?

Oh, but I just told you. --

Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.

The winning side would have paid you much better.

That makes Rick a citizen of the world.

Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.

You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.

Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?

Where were you last night?

Hello?

Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.

Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --

Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.

Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.

This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?

Get up.

Thirsty.

Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.

Do too little you'll die.

Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.

Get water!

What are you doing?

I'm lost.  Goodbye.

What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.

I float.  You sink.  End of story.

What's so damn funny?

Yeah.  A long time ago.

Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.

Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?

My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.

How was Russia?

Got to follow the paper path here.

Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.

Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.

I have to.

This isn't working out.

No.

Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.

Chuck, you're breaking my heart.

I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

Right back, you said you'd be right back.

I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.

All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.

What's that, written on the sail?

There was a coffin?

You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.

Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?

Which I didn't have.

Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.

Need some help?

I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.

When'd you start working here?

What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.

What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?

How'd it go?

You what?

Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.

And never take.

A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.

I beat the odds!

What, then?

Thanks.  For everything.

I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!

He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!

You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!

These *credentials* are against the law!

I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?

He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!

What'd she die of?

Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?

Shouldn't we tell Homer?

I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.

I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.

And what did she die of, exactly?

What's the *medical* explanation?

What are you so crazy about the movies for?

At least you were never lonely.

Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.

I *know* this was right.

Stop it! Just cut it out!

"...did." Well, okay.

And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...

I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...

You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.

I'm okay--I can walk.

I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.

He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.

You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.

"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."

Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!

Did you know your mother better?

No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.

So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--

Liberator...

I wonder if you might give me a ride.

At what altitude?

You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.

What business is you in, Homer?

Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.

I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.

You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?

How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?

I don't need this--I know all about my condition.

Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.

You okay, Rose?

You're not yet three months, are you?

You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?

Don't this place look like home?

It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.

That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.

Rose Rose has runned away!

My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.

So, what do you do?

Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.

Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --

This has to happen fast.

Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.

It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.

And I think it's because of this redhead...

I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.

He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.

We were back on.

Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?

We'll take care of it.

The red hair... It's bad luck.

I'm going home

That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!

Shit.

When?

She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.

Calls?

Stake you?

That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?

Listen, Scooter --

Look at you, you skinny prick.

Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?

Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.

Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.

Oh Jesus!

What about... The money?

That's not --

Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.

Says who?

No.  What's my cut?

I gotta go get a haircut.

We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...

Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?

How do you know I will?

You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.

Did, uh... Did you kill him?

No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.

Jesus... Take it easy.

You are such a raving pussy sometimes.

Everyone's working an angle, right?

Your mess.

Stop waving that thing around.

No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.

So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --

What do we do? We change the scam?

No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!

King ain't gonna like this.

What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.

Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.

Can't say.

The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.

Special Agent?

You guys awake?

Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.

Jack. Do you need a ride?

My car's in the garage.

I hate cheats.

What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?

She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.

And your lady?

A bit unexpected, wasn't it?

I couldn't resist them.

Take it back. Till you sell your book.

I had training. In the Republic.

Are you trying to read my palm?

You're shaking. What is it?

I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?

What?

Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?

How did you know I was here?

What?

No.

So how are you doing, dad?

To coincidence.

No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally

Toss you for it.

Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.

I didn't.

I know that. But you can now.

How much do you owe?

Did they tell you to sleep with me?

Yes.

I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?

What are you, a cop?

Does Bella come here?

Hey Jack, join us.

I'm off. I need to sleep.

I can't give you a lift back tonight.

What happened to Bella?

You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.

You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.

David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.

In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?

I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.

Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.

For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.

We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.

That hair will have to go.

Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.

I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.

Yeah.

Where is the key?

What was that, I didn't hear...

Find me something, I don't care where it is.

Quantum is up thirty-five.

Rechannel all safety relays --

One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?

The only thing which exists is myself.

This is fun.

That's it.

Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?

In a second.

Commander Powell would have named it.

Wha?

Veil nebula.

It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...

I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.

What happened, Doolittle?

Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.

Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.

You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.

Men... men... what happened, men?

But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.

What?

Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.

Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.

Why would I be pissed?

What is it?

Lemme put some clothes on.

Where'd you clip this?

Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.

Same old story.  Not interested.

Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.

I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.

You're light a deuce.

What a creep.

Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...

Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.

No...

Sophy?  Are you okay?

I was expecting someone else.

I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.

Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--

Sorry about your window.

Lemme get my coat.

How'd you find me?

You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?

Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.

I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.

Your basic hodge-podge.

I already don't like the sound of this.

I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.

You believe that?

Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.

Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.

That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.

But she does work here?

I need to talk to her.

None.

Who is it?

What do you want?

You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.

Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.

Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.

She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.

As long as you're okay.

I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.

They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.

Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?

Yeah.

A fog bank.

Gotta go.

So are dogs.

I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.

So, how do you get the woman to come to me?

It's payday, need me to pick up your check?

Probably a touch of what's going around.

Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.

A toy?

I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.

She was the one--

That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--

I want you on call here.

More like deployed in bed asleep.

Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.

Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.

What's that?

Whoa... she is a killer.

I-I c-can't...

Beth? I can't believe it.

I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.

Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?

This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.

I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.

You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.

So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!

Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...

There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?

Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.

Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?

Now listen up. Here's the game plan.

No... You don't think...?

Could be.

Are you gettin' wise with me?

Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.

How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?

Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.

Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.

Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.

Wait! I know how we can get in!

Change? What's wrong with what I got on?

Mom, what're we...?

I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!

The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.

Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.

But we took the keys?

What do you want?

Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!

Gimme your gun, boy!

Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!

Hi... what's going on here?

Dr. Monnitoff?

Theoretically.

That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.

Did you tell them that I flooded the school?

Why did you make me flood the school?

Wanna walk me home?

Wow. Did he go to jail?

I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.

Where are we going?

Where are you going?

What happened to your neck?

That's alright... I understand.

I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.

Will you please talk to me?

I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.

Did you call the cops?

I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.

No. Frank.

Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?

You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.

You're my only son...

Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?

I think he saved my life.

And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?

What is her name?

How many times have you seen Frank?

Can anyone else see him?

Nothing.

Yeah... you know...  Fucking.

They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.

I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.

Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.

I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.

I... What can we do?

Our son just called me a bitch.

Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...

Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.

What is this shit?

Smurfette doesn't fuck.

We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.

Is Mom okay?

You're what?!

I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!

That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.

Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.

Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.

Ow!

God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.

What're you doin' here?

What?

Here, I didn't get any.

So, anyone talk to Janelle?

I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.

So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.

Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...

They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.

Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.

Okay?

And the year before that?

...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.

Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.

Lester?

Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.

Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?

That's enough!

...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --

Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!

Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.

Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"

Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.

Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.

Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.

From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!

There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?

Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.

Here I am, Father...

He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.

Father...

Yes -- why?

What's the matter with you?

That was for you.

What other job you got?

My card.

You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?

I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".

Now -- how many men you got in your army?

Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.

We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA

If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!

Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?

I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.

I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.

That's what you think.

Oh -- you mean... worm?

Was it -- swine?

Oh yes! -- UPSTART!

What'll I do with this card?

Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.

You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.

So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...

Oh, won't you reconsider...

I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.

Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.

One or two?

John loves the house.

Like this. 

I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?

Good morning, Treves.

Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.

Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?

I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.

Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?

It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.

...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.

Are you comfortable here?

I say Freddie, what are you about?

Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?

An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.

Oh, no.

John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.

Is he... dying then?

You alright?

Yyess.

Merrick...

I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?

The hospital?

Who are they of?

How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?

Are you sure? Because I can take it back.

Yes John?

Goodnight John. Sleep well.

Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.

Watery headed bunch.

Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.

Yes sir.  What's that?

So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.

Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?

Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.

Those things in your hands.

What's the matter?

What?

WHY?

The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.

Oh, for goodness' sake!

You're as bad as my father.

Then I shall come too.

But --

What do you see, Erik?

And will the dead ever return, Freya?

No... we don't...

Would you like us to sing to you?

You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?

Is there something the matter with it?

Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?

But it IS! Look!

Looting and pillaging, eh?

What about the raping?

No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...

Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.

Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!

Why should you care?

Have you tried to ask the God for anything?

Is THAT Odin?

What are you talking about?

Halfdan the Black's here!

Look, the sky is blue...

Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.

It's SO nice to feel wanted.

Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.

You'll be sucked down too!

You need to say a bit more than that!

What do you think?

Well, what else do we do?

And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?

Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.

Hey, you two! What's going on?

I AM one, Dad!

Vanish into thin air?

Are you all right?

He used to puke in his sleep.

And a sort of slightly sick feeling?

Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!

Aaagh!

What?

If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.

Can't make enough axe-heads!

They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...

My brother blacksmiths!

Wasn't it, Keitel?

Sh! Hurry!

Help!

I should have got rid of you long ago!

Made by YOU, Loki!

It's a tradition.

I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...

Well I'M certainly not, either.

Well... I'm game.

Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.

You weren't supposed to see that.

Yeah, you told me that later.

Ms. Kruczynski?

How are you today?

Oh, Tangerine.

I'm so excited. Yay!

I didn't have a chance to wrap it.

What's wrong with me?

Really? Because --

I like it.

You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?

My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.

Frost?

Well, I should probably get going.

Thanks.

Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.

You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.

What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?

Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?

Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.

How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?

Let me drive you home.

Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?

Let's talk about it later.

Yeah.

I'm sure, I said.

I dropped you off after. You said --

I told her today I need to end it.

Well, you're married.

I'll give you a couple. See what you think.

I think, before.

Male or female?

Cool.

What if you stay this time?

Bye, Joel.

Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.

Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.

I probably got the same thing as you.

Hi, it's Joel.

I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.

We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.

What? What do you mean?

So what's going on, Joel?

Don't say "we" when you mean "you."

Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.

Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.

So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.

Stan... c'mon...

Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --

It's freezing out.

No way. I can handle this.

You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.

What do you want, Stan?

Howard, your one o'clock.

Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."

There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.

I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.

You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --

Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?

You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.

The voltage looks fine.

I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.

Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?

She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.

What was that?

Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.

Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?

You're political, then?

Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.

No, I guess not.

Extraordinary!

I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.

So now you're bummin' around?

Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.

You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.

But Countess...

But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?

Ballast.

You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.

Time to play Spam in the can.

But Justin...

Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.

What?

It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...

He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...

How is he?

I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.

Do you hear it? Right there.

DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.

I've got a pulse, he's alive...

It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.

Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.

But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...

This is Weir.

Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.

I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.

What's the hold up?

Okay. I'm on the bridge.

Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.

Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...

Peters...

I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.

That's a negative, Starck.

Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...

I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.

It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.

You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.

No one?

What could cause them?  What's in the Core?

I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.

It's 2041...

What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?

We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.

I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.

What about my ship?

I told you... She won't let you leave...

Weir is dead.

You can't have them. Go to hell.

1500 meters. We're getting too close...

It is now.  We're locked in.

Sir.

Now what?

Smith, get out of there...

Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.

Something's wrong with the bio-scan.

That's an affirmative.

I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.

I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.

Who?

...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...

First time in a grav couch?

Claire...

Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?

There's no one in the corridor but us.

Hey...

What?

I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...

30 hours to Neptune orbit.

Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.

Claire is your wife?

It must be hard, being so far away from her.

What are you doing?

Those yours too?

You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --

I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?

He didn't.

Where is Reed?

What do you want, Vic?

He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."

Isn't that your speech?

How long was I out?

What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --

You got a chisel round here?

Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --

Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...

Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.

Yeah, well, his eyes say different.

They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --

Hey! That's a prototype!

The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --

But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...

Me like-y.

Now what is up with that?

Johnny. SUPERNOVA.

Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?

You're really cramping my style here.

They're ready for you, sir.

Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --

I, uh, think I remember the number.

As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --

Feeling better?

That's good. That's uh... good.

How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?

Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...

Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --

I found a broken gasket, from space --

Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.

Ben's still out there --

What's going on?

Victor, your scar --

If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --

Brad, can I talk to you a minute?

Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.

Were those flowers really for me, Brad?

Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.

I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.

Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!

I take out the garbage.

Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?

Is everything okay at work?

Does Mom know you have company?

You're not going to tell me, are you?

Any problems?

Leave me alone!

Leave me alone.

Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.

I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?

Are you really a virgin?

Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.

Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.

Hey, Rat.

Did you go home and get it?

Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.

Who's that?

Seen the new Playboy?

I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.

Do you think guys find that attractive?

No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.

Well I never did it.

There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.

You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.

What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.

God, he hardly even talks anymore.

It couldn't be.

Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!

You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.

Where's Doug?

Not coming? What happened?

I can't believe it! But what about Doug?

Mr. Spicoli?

Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!

Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?

Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.

Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?

Do you want to sit there, Jeff?

Well, you'll find out next year.

Thanks for picking me up.

'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.

Where do you feel like going?

It's very warm out tonight.

Are you really nineteen?

This is a nice car.

This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?

Where's Mike today?

I made a fool of myself.

Hi, Mark.

Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.

Are you ready to order here?

But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?

What's the message? My light is blinking.

Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...

What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?

Naked!?

Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.

Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.

Naw!

I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?

If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...

O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?

You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.

That's good...

Jesus creeping shit!

I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.

Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?

Yeah... I thought we might need it...

That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!

Where'd you get that knife?

What tape?

You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.

Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!

Jesus.

You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?

What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!

Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.

NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!

This is a fucking nightmare.

Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.

What is this?

I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.

What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!

Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.

Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?

You know where it is?

IS IT CLEAR?!

I think I know where a CB is.

That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.

Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.

I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.

What now, Geronimo?

It's imperative that you get that truck moving.

Oh, no.

Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.

Um-hmmm.

He's dead.

Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.

What do you mean what?

How many?

Nine?

Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!

Welcome back.

'Eh, Chief?

NO, but I will lock you in.

Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?

HELP MEEE!

What's wrong?

Let's wait it out.

Okay, well that's something.

Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.

Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.

Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?

Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?

Are you lying to me?

You know that no one likes a liar, right?

Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.

Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."

No, I'm concerned with everything.

Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.

I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?

Where's Clifford?

You don't think I'm good enough?

Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?

Hey, where's the fire, sister?

Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?

We're all square now, Harry. Right?

No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.

You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?

Bye, baby.

You wrote it, didn't you?

Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?

Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.

It's already started, Dad... with me.

What do I do, Dad?

...So what do you think?

But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?

I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 

Bread?

Oh, Kurt!

Why... yes.

I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?

Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!

Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.

How'd I look?

Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.

What?

Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.

Frances...

Well... don't you think it's up to me to...

Shit. I meant the other way around.

Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.

Nice joint. Can you afford it?

What for?

What a man!

You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.

You give up on her?

Frances, You're crazy.

Frances, it's me, Harry?

Right. Except... time has a way of --

How... how ya doin', Farmer?

I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?

Yeah.

Did you expect him to look you up?

Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?

I live here.

What?

That's me, Clifford.

'But how do I know you love me?'

How's it sound?

It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.

Don't... talk crazy.

I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!

Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.

You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.

Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?

On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --

Yes...?

So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?

You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.

Normal. Average.

...Did you really say that?

This whole thing is a joke!

Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.

What?

Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.

Huh?

I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!

And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?

Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?

I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.

I am as he made me. In his own image.

Nice.

Why?

Come warm yourself if you like.

Friend?

GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!

That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.

Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!

Nothing. Still nothing.

He always was opinionated.

How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?

Smell the air. Wonderful.

Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.

You will.  What do you want, Victor?

You make me weak.

Our decision. Together.

I give you my soul...

My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.

What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.

We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.

I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.

Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.

I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.

Are you having me on?

...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.

And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.

They just caught the man who did it.

They'll hang him all the same.

You're making a scene!

We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.

It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.

Are you sure you'll be all right?

I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.

Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.

You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.

Preposterous.

Re-configure the leads?

Victor. He was trying to be gracious.

Good night, Alice.

You want to leave?

I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?

And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.

What'll you do when you leave here?

I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?

I don't hear it anymore.

I'll be along.

You just had some lucky shots.

What do you want to be when you grow up?

No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?

Ha!

What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?

Jack?

This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?

Are you wet?

Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...

You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.

I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!

Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.

Good luck.

What is your purpose in Mexico?

Yeah, follow us.

Why did they block the door again?

What's your name?

It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.

If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.

She's dead?

Died instantly?

I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?

You're a preacher?

I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.

Didn't like it, did ya?

Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.

Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

Who else?

Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.

Now, is your shit together?

You too, preacher?

What's this stuff?

It's the bitterest of pills.

About two hours from now.

You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?

Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...

What's going on?

We have to go back for Daddy!

Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --

Not even for lunch?

Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.

He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.

Were you giving that pig signals?

He says you were scratching.

Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?

Best in Mexico.

Do they have cable?

Do they have a waterbed?

Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.

All I'm saying --

I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.

Where's the woman?

What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?

No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.

Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?

Richard!

This ain't the time, Richard.

I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?

I don't know, you just passed out.

Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.

Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!

You could take their head off.

Administration, Ensign Blondell.

Got it.

Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.

Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?

Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --

No, sir, WHAT?

And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.

Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --

I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."

Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?

Ah, c'mon...

... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --

The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.

Would I be the only one?  The only woman?

Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --

Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.

Should probably ask him that.

What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?

What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?

Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?

Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.

Close as I can get, el-tee!

I'll try anyway, sir.

The Navy Cross...

Just a coincidence?

Lieutenant O'Neil.

Unless you Whiskey Run.

Probably hear back from CNN first.

Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.

So dump on me.

Well, guess I don't even need to be here...

Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?

C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.

Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.

First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.

What're you guys doing?  Huh?

So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?

Chief, sir, I don't understand why --

I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.

Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.

You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.

I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --

Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?

Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.

Anybody usin' these drawers here?

Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.

Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.

I take it this file is still open.

Me!? You where the one...

Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?

Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.

Animal, I can't.

Think we can fit up in there?

So, you still picking apart cockroaches?

Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?

And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?

Wish me luck!

Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.

I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...

You don't understand, I can get us information...

We've secured the doors on both levels.

And how should we do that, Sir?

Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.

Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?

Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.

What sample?

You gave them the tape?

We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.

General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.

Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.

It's the French Secret Service.

I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.

So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?

I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?

Who the hell are you?

I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?

"The show must go on."

God, what an ass.

Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.

We've got to stop!

You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts

About this much.

Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!

What's happened?

A boy comes to the door.

May I get the check?

WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!

Those blue things ate everybody here?

Hi Brandon.

I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.

Yes...?

But you don't?

Go. They're off again.

Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.

Systems register functional.

U.... What do you think?

Covalent... Right. So...

The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?

No, I'll kill you. .

How do you remember this stuff?

THAT'S why you built this ship?

I am SO SICK of being right.

It's... I don't know.

That's it, that's what's going to kill me.

It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!

We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?

More to the left... Stay parallel...

"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.

We're alive!

This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...

It's Jason...

Wait. When are you going to tell them?

We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.

There's nobody here. Jason...

Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!

Unbelievable.

That's it, It's go time.

You should have let me hit him.

My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.

We pretend...

Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.

Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?

Commander?... Where are you... going?

You... You mean Earth?

Theramin.

How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.

Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?

"Deception..." "Lies."

... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-

That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.

Oh, right, sorry.

Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.

Over three hundred miles.

They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.

What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.

I hope I never have to believe that.

There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!

Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.

Me?  You apologizing to me?

What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?

General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.

Who is that!?

Yessir.

What's your advice, Alexander?

I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?

Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?

Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.

Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.

With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.

George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...

No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.

No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.

If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.

That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable.

'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.

And how rusty are these muskets?

Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.

What is it, Marquis?

It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.

I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...

Leave me, now sir, I am tired.

Not today.

A horseshoer?

The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!

They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.

George, you know I only love you, but...

Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.

So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.

Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.

The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'.

Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?

I say!

And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...

He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.

His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...

Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.

After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.

What about him?

You get life for kidnapping.

About sixty.

He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?

You gave him the money?

You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.

You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.

Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people -

Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?

C-18.

Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.

I work for Harry Zimm, alright?

Or else what?

You say look at you?

Why would I do that?

I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.

The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.

Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.

I'm looking at you.

Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?

Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.

I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.

I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.

Ever shot anybody.

Really? You ever been arrested?

These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal - this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer -

"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?

Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.

One of his best parts.

That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -

What do you get out of this?

Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.

Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.

You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?

Yeah, he told me.

It was in the Herald.

Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.

So you want to know.

I'm thinking of a movie.

The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.

Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.

I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.

You've been losing.

You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?

Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.

The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?

But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.

Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.

Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."

That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?

Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.

You been here the whole time?

I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.

This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...

That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.

How'd you meet Martin anyway?

I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -

Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!

I'll be right back.

They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?

I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.

All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.

He already knew it.

Hello, Doris.

Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?

I mean morally. Murray was my friend.

When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.

Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.

Harry, we spoke with Martin.

The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.

Oh, for Christ's sake -

Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.

A passenger liner, north island. Over.

Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.

Fucker!

Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.

Where from?

One more?

Maureen.

Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.

Ready?

If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.

One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.

I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.

Did you?

Dodge.  Dodge.

What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.

If you get it back in one piece.

Mother fucker!

What's this?

How long?

Goddamit, Dodge.

Or somebody stopped them.

If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.

Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.

I think you know.

What?!

What the hell happened!

Then why didn't they take it.

That's a good thing?

Coffee.

What'd you find up there?

She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.

I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.

Why not call for help?

Take it easy, you'll live longer.

You sure it wasn't me?

So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.

Murphy to Epps.

He needs a doctor.

They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.

It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.

Hey.

Couldn't sleep.

No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.

She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.

Murphy, don't you see what's happening?

The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.

I must be in the wrong business.

All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.

If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.

Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?

Greer?

Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.

What happened?

We're not gonna be able to pump it!

Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.

We're still drifting.

He took the shotgun and a light.

Can't find the shotgun.

What about the gold?

Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.

Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.

These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.

Maxine.

Yup.

Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.

Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.

Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.

Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...

And what can you tell us about this... 

These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.

Did you actually do this painting?

And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?

Hmm.

I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?

The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --

Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!

I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.

Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...

Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.

So Josh...

So, where's "Weird Al"?

Do you want something to drink?

When did I say I hated you?

You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!

Yeah, well --

How long have you been up?

Okay... I promise.

Hi Enid.

God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.

You can have that one.

Does Oomie really like this show?

Hey - why do you have this?

You call.

You're better at it.

Look, maybe that's him!

I want to "make love" to him.

It's obviously him!

Do you think he knows?

This is way too creepy.

The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!

He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...

Not really...

We still have to go in there sometime.

Where are we going?

How about this one?

Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.

I know a party we could go to...

Just now... I went with Seymour.

Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.

You're just jealous.

Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...

I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.

What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!

This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.

Do you want to do something tonight?

Don't you want nice stuff?

Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?

That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.

Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...

When was this?

Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...

You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!

I dunno...

What about me? Am I not even here?

I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!

It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.

A what?

Do you have any other old records besides these?

Punk rock is over!

Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...

That's five hundred dollars.

You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.

Is this one any good?

You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?

We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.

Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?

Relax, Seymour, relax...

Yes, that would certainly do...

Wow, this is so cool...

Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.

So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?

You can open your eyes now.

What is that?

Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...

I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!

I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?

Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!

Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...

...so... is he your boyfriend now?

Well when can we do something?

...What do you mean?

What's up?

Uh... sure... come in.

Where did you get this?

I'm just being realistic.

Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?

So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?

Please Josh?

Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?

I have no idea - I just want to...

I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.

Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.

I am a man of peace.

And it worked?

I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.

Understand, I had help-

I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.

All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.

I don't suppose I could watch.

I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?

I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-

Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?

I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.

I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.

The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?

Samuel says you killed a lion.

Goddammit!

It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 

I'll be bait alone?

I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.

Why do the workers look unhappy?

It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.

Nonsense.

We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.

Good news?

Soon. 

Where is it?

Afraid of lions.

Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?

How many cattle?

Where do you go next?

We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?

Janosz?

Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.

Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.

We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.

Occasionally

Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.

Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?

That's where the buggy stopped.

Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.

You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?

I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.

All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?

I'm not even good for me.

That's a terrible thing to say.

I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.

Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?

What is it, honey?

Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?

Should we go?

We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.

I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.

You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?

Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.

You've got to do something!

They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.

Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?

Your honor, may I approach the bench?

That's it?  That's all you have to say?

Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.

Yes, I did.  We were city champs.

That's a thousand million electron volts.

You were supposed to help me with this.

We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.

Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.

Who?

Well, Holmes, what do you think?

Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.

I'm Ray --

Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.

It looks like a giant Jello mold.

Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.

I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.

I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.

Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.

What's your story, Pete?

Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?

What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.

She's moving!

Tell him about the toaster.

And pure --

How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.

Roy?  Your clock broke.

Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!

Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?

Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?

Uh-huh.

You're quite a housekeeper.

There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.

I think I should spend the night here.

Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.

Okay.  Then I'll go.

Who's the stiff?

Can't you tell me now?

Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."

What's he doing in my refrigerator.

All right.  Since you put it that way.

He is the Destructor.

Do you want this body?

I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.

Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.

Oh, that's very - unusual.

I want you to have this. 

Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.

I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.

And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?

May I please see the storage facility?

At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.

You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.

Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.

Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?

Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.

Something was definitely here.

Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.

I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?

Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.

Sorry, Buddy!

You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.

But most people are afraid to even report these things.

They will.

So do I.

I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.

Third floor.  Get down here,

Boy, that was a rough one.

Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?

Are you a Christian, Ray?

You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.

That's what you told me two days ago!

No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.

You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.

"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."

But they're not destroyed, not yet.

Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.

Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!

Maybe it'll crush Gaius.

Take grain away from the army?

It's because he comes off as the underdog.

"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.

AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.

So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...

My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.

The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.

I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.

I've read of it.

Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.

Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.

My loyalties... were in doubt.

Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?

I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.

Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.

"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."

You cannot die.

Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?

I made the plume from a quail feather.

What the hell was all that about?

Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?

He's very realistic.

Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.

What about their philosophy lessons?

You need to come home!

I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?

Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.

When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.

You're not going!  You have to stay with us!

Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?

General, do you realize what happened out there today?

General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.

Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.

But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!

Before they leave, get gold.

So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.

Hello.

You're living at home now. Is that right?

Why not?

Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.

Is anything wrong?

Where we going?

Benjamin -- do they know you?

Yes.

What's the matter?

Elaine --

No -- don't cry --

Is that him over there?

-- really incredible --

I said I think it is.

-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.

Can I just sit here while you're packing?

I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.

Is that so? You might marry me?

We just can.

I just don't think it would work.

Carl who?

Well, what did he say? I'm curious.

Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --

Are you listening?

What are you then?

Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.

What did you do to her?

See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.

Mr. McCleery?

What for?

I'd rather not.

Where are you?

Where are you?

Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.

Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?

Where is your luggage?

Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?

Is there an ashtray in here?

Is it a girl?

In general.

What do you drink? Bourbon?

Please wait till my husband gets home.

Drink?

Are you always this much afraid of being alone?

I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.

Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.

I don't remember her as having brown eyes.

I think I'll go to bed.

Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?

If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.

Do you understand what I said?

Yes, I do.

May I have a drink?

Did you get us a room?

Have you gotten us a room yet?

Yes -- I think that would be good.

Yes?

What?

Yes?

Will you bring me a hanger?

Thank you.

It's nothing to be ashamed of --

-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --

Good. I mean are we dead or something?

Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.

Oh.

Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.

Do you want to hear it or not?

Now let's keep going here.

Well how long has this been going on.

Oh no. Are you kidding me?

Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.

But you don't hate him.

What?

Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...

And you were a student also.

Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?

Oh no. In the car you did it?

A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!

Don't talk about Elaine.

Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --

Good.

No.

Well, I'm not.

Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.

Did I say that?

Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.

Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.

But it's not.

Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.

Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.

Hello. Get me the police, please.

What have you done to her?

You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.

I say I've got it.

The toothbrush. I got it all right.

I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?

I do.

Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --

I'm going up to Berkeley today.

When did you two talk this over?

I guess -- about my future.

Have you thought about graduate school?

How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.

Thank you very much, sir.

Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.

Thank you.

Hello.

I am not threatening you.

No, I don't.

But why?

Are you ready in there, feature attraction?

I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.

The Carlsons' are here.

What's happening?

Turn 'em up.

I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!

She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?

And what are you going to do?

I don't like your tone.

I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.

I'll pay you back.

I have an idea working in my head... 

Like dancing?

You?

Reducing?

Yes? -- Tomorrow?

Yes -- I'd love to.

Why?

You're not a bit like you were yesterday.

Nothing -- only to be here.

Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.

Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --

He disappeared. Later he was found dead.

I want to be alone --

The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?

No.

That's a silly joke.

Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.

I can't.

No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...

On the train?

Then you know him?

Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...

A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?

Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.

Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.

You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.

Oh -- good evening, Baron.

My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.

Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.

The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.

Telegrams?

I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.

You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?

Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.

You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.

You've nothing to fear, Kringelein

If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.

You're trembling.

You loved the Baron, didn't you?

So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.

When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...

How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?

You're a very unusual stenographer --

You...

What?

What brown hands you have.

A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.

You're a little too fast.

You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --

Can you pay some attention to me?

You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.

Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.

If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.

There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?

No water -- What a place!

Yes --

What?

As you remember it -- when you approached us...

Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 

Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --

Madam has slept well?

Madam should sleep.

When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.

What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?

I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?

Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.

Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.

If you will wait one moment, sir.

We will wait.

If the house is empty again, I don't know --

Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.

You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.

You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?

One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?

Your what?

I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.

You're calling the shots.

No.

You ever hear about the oranges?

You want a drink?

Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.

I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.

I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.

Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.

Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.

Want a look?

You ruined me! You destroyed me!

Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.

Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.

Yes, yes, but that's --

Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.

Well, I'd have to see it, of course.

Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?

Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.

That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?

They knocked out my tooth!

Up to you.

That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.

You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!

Roy, I don't want money from you.

Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.

It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --

I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --

At what?

And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.

You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.

A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.

For God's sake, Lilly!

Well, uh...

I didn't teach you that.

Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?

You aren't taking me for granted, are you?

And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.

What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?

You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.

Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.

Working the what?

He retired.

Upstate.

Atascadero.

Think about it. Okay?

Yeah?

You -- I don't know.

) The track? Did you run into Lilly?

I don't think I need it.

What I say is, no. We don't do partners.

That's natural.

Not many laughs in this room, eh?

Oh, Jesus.

That's that, then.

That's true, Mr. Simms.

Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.

With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.

Where?

Do you know who did this?

No shit?!

Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...

I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.

It's an option.

Where are you going?

He found you, didn't he?

I'm not leaving without her.

Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.

Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.

You look kind of cold.

Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.

Hey, you alright?

So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?

Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.

Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?

Guess they -- went to the fair after all.

Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?

They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?

Mom, I want to go to the fair ...

God, what's wrong with him?

Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.

Where are you going?

We need you, Dr. Loomis.

But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.

There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.

What do you know about Michael?

No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!

A bitch.

We've never met.

I suppose.

You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.

I didn't tell you everything.

You told me.

I told you the uniform wouldn't help.

You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.

All the more reason to go to Africa.

You know her for what she is now-- garbage.

I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?

I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.

I don't think so.  It could have been.

Hello.

Is Penelope in?

Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.

Fifty years?

If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.

For Africa.

You're my buddy.

You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.

Anybody home?

The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.

And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?

College?

What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?

What does he do--of an athletic nature?

Oh hell.

Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.

We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!

We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.

Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?

We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.

Mhravitch.  Remember that name.

He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.

I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.

Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.

Dad--

A hundred dollars for breakfast?

Gee whiz, Dad--

How do you do?

What's the matter?

Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.

Bluh.

Your old beau?

I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.

Harold!

Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!

Which one?

Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.

What then?

Tell me about its sexual roots.

I came for Paul as well.

A dozen?

That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.

No.

I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.

I mean it!

...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.

I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.

I feel the same way.  What next?

Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.

Wasn't that sweet of me?

It died for your sins.

What brought you back?

There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?

I love you!  Have a cigar!

I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?

I'm an honorable clown?

Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.

Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?

Leave the rifle here.

Who's dead?

How horrible.

What's this?

I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.

I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!

That's an interesting piece of news.

Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?

Yes, he is.

Mom?

What does he say to do?

Please--

I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.

He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.

He'd assume we had.

This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.

Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.

What then?

Is he coming home?

I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.

Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.

What was it?

What's the matter now?

The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.

I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.

This is very good for us.

The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.

The what?

Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.

They didn't murder me.

If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.

Thank you.  Thank you very much.

You fool, you fool.

Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.

Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.

You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?

You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.

Kid--kid--

Minors aren't allowed at fights.

Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.

Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?

The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.

We aren't gonna arrest him for that...

There's a girl I want to ask you about.

No, I don't.

What?

No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.

Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.

Don't you think it's a little too... bright?

Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.

Are you sure it's all right?

Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?

The other girl is the star?

No. I saw her with Tod.

Where's he?

Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.

Up front?

You won't keep growing at this rate.

Why? Are you a sex fiend?

What's T-J?

Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.

I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'

More or less.

Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.

I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.

I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...

Where are you? The connection sounds very good.

Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?

Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.

Where is she?

The police? They know less than you do.

What are you doing here?

You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?

What happened, pilgrim?

What happened?

How's your business, Jake?

I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.

I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.

Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.

God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.

What you got in mind?

Where's Ratan?

Here. Take your fifty cents back.

Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.

It's an investment.

I thought you were a businessman.

What does that do?

Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.

To his own daughter?

The guy who bought you that ring.

Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?

You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.

Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.

Yes.

No.

Edith was just telling me about her job.

Sorry I'm late.

What do you see?

Here's your shovel.

Do you dance?

But this is my car.

But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?

It goes on and on.

You look as if you could.

Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?

I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?

Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.

What happened?

What?

No.

I think he's following us.

There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?

Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.

Don't you think we should turn off the heat?

I'm sure picking up on vices.

You are the wisest person I know.

This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .

No. I'd feel stupid.

It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."

From the guys who got the matches, of course. 

Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.

Oh.

Maude, I must speak to you.

Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...

Don't you advance on me.

You sure have a way with people.

Do you think there is any life up there?

Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.

Why?

I'm getting married.

Would you like a cigarette?

Is Sunshine your real name?

And why is that?

Just give me a rough estimate.

Yes. It does.

I put a lot of effort into these things.

That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?

Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?

I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?

You liked your teachers?

Then why did you leave?

Why?

Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.

And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.

Yes.

How about hand-to-hand combat?

To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.

I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.

Parasite!

Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?

Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.

Frank.

He... he loved me.

Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!

I want to go back!

I knew you'd come back.

Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.

Get out of the way.

I've got to finish it.

Wait!

What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.

I need to touch it to "see"...

I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --

Red. How long was it latched onto you?

Remind me why I keep doing this.

hound of resurrection --

Here. You'll need one of these.

C'mon -- Rasputin??

What the hell was that? An ape?

I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!

These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.

Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.

On the desk, yes. In Latin.

I'm in way over my head, I know that much.

Got tired of me?

It is. You got yourself on TV again.

She's dead.

"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.

We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...

Each of us gets a belt.

-- should go back. Now!

You're kidding --

What took you so long?

What are you, a Boy Scout?

What was that??

We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --

Hit me.

It's my lucky day.

Alright, let's give it another try.

That your daughter?

Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.

Nobody escapes us.

Just in time.

That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.

You were holding onto it like grim death.

Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.

I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.

I'm brother Frank.

There is going to BE a wedding?

But you said --

What about Larry --

Help me.

Well?

A long time.

This is what began it.

Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.

So where's the harm?

There's a towel in the bathroom.

Kirsty? It's very late.

This afternoon.

You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.

Larry!

How are you doing through there?

Is it deep?

Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.

Are you all right?

What's wrong with you?

What are you talking about?

What are you drinking?

This isn't the bedroom.

Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.

What a pretty tune.

You wouldn't believe me.

Where are you?

What are you drinking, love?

Yeah.

...maybe we should never have come back.

I guess.

It's like she's waiting for something.

I have to talk to you.

Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.

Get the fuck out of here.

You're not going?

Oh!

These THINGS... they want to take me --

What are you doing?

Don't you want to hear what's next?

Play it.

Nice, Barry.

You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.

Not the point.

It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.

I wanna date a musician...

What did you tell her about the shop for?

What are you snickering about?

"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.

Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"

Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.

They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.

Isn't it?

Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!

You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?

Sonic Death Monkey.

You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.

Great.  Can I have it then?

What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --

Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?

She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."

Who are you going to see?

Anna.

Hey, Barry.

What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.

Your desert island top-five.

Is there a difference?

Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.

Sure, but is that it for the list?

Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --

Yeah.

And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?

Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?

Huh?

It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.

'Morning, Dick.

What's this?

Let's not.

Rob --!

Well we rang $900 today.

Laura?  Are you okay?

Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.

Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.

Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.

Jeez.  He goes on long enough.

Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!

Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?

What's the obvious stuff?

What?

I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.

Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.

No problem.  If I can ask one question.

I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?

Is that why you wanted to see me?

We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.

Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --

He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.

I'm sure.

You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.

Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?

What?

I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.

Look, we can do other things.

What it was like.

I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.

How?  How were we the same people?

I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.

Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?

I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.

Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?

Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.

I know.

Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?

Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?

What's the -- hey, Liz --

To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!

So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?

You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.

Is Ray going?

Enough, Liz.

Don't you like that?

Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...

What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.

Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.

Are you okay?

For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.

I'd like it if you could stay the night.

Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.

Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?

Hi, Mom.

So so.  Up and down.

She left.  She's gone.

What do you think?

That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.

Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.

With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.

I think you have more.

We're not there yet, Justin.

Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.

How old is Richard?

He'd want to know about all this.

I warned you.

Doesn't have a head, does he?

Huh?

Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.

Would you remember his name?

-Okay okay.

Someone beat you.

You have an active imagination.

He called you "MacLeod".

He was innocent.

What's all that?

The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.

No.  So what now?  We just wait?

Maybe it would do us both good.

I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.

Not the same.

I haven't killed _you_.

Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.

What is it?

The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?

What were you doing in Felton?

Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.

Corey, you _owe_ me.

Good way to lose your job.

Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.

-Et lux perpetua-

Stop.

Aye.

Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?

You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.

In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.

I don't understand.

But we cannot be killed.

As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.

It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.

You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.

I'm your future husband, remember?

My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.

Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.

I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.

Your name?

I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.

Don't threaten me, Private.

Ah, Conor, how you look a man.

I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.

Smith.  Carl Smith.

Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.

And have you something to settle with me?

But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?

Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.

Run!

What's the point?

What's the point!  You have me, finish it!

Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.

We have some unfinished business.

Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?

Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?

Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.

Steven, Conor didn't die.

When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.

Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.

How do you mean?

Oh, it isn't like that.

Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.

Too hot?

Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?

Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.

But I don't gamble, Hilda!

Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?

Mr. Burns --

This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.

But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?

I feel I ought to take care of her.

Well, of course, if you put it that way.

Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.

Hildy!

And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...

Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?

You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.

What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?

You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.

Duffy! Get Liebowitz!

Save that for the Tribune.

Hello, Hildy!

Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?

What do you mean by that?

Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.

Sweeney.

Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!

You've got to help me, Hildy.

It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.

If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.

Bermuda.

Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.

I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.

Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.

Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.

Afraid? I should say not!

You said it.

The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.

What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?

You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.

It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.

Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?

She jumped out of the window.

Hildy!

Railroad tickets.

Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!

Look at me, Hildy --

What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?

We've certainly been in some swell jams.

Well -- what is it?

Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.

Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.

That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!

Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.

It'll be Heaven!

Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.

Are you referring to me, Madam?

You stay here. I'll find out everything.

Who do you want?

Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!

There's money in it, Cooley.

Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?

Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.

Are you gentlemen all through with me?

I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?

Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.

I call. What you got?

Open up there, will you!

A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.

You guys wanna play some more poker?

So have we!

Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.

Come on, you! Before we slap you down.

I'll call.

All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.

Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.

I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.

Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?

He's harmless.

If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.

I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?

For who?

Pete, I want to talk to you!

Did you actually give Williams that gun?

Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!

Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!

We'll fix that, too. 

All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.

Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.

You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!

Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.

I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.

All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!

You can let him out on bail, can't you?

You'll take fifty and like it!

Where's the old lady?

I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!

Who is it?

It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.

You fight it cut.

Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?

Did you get that, Hildy?

Look out, you --

Hiding him where?

Mother!

I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.

Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.

It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?

A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.

How'd you get here, Earl?

They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!

I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.

You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.

How much do you make a week?

Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.

But how do I know...?

Is it hard?

They wouldn't take it.

Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.

What's he want?

Can I try?

Never let a rat creep up on you.

You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.

What are you doing here? This is our territory

My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."

I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.

I did see them. I did.

You're the biggest fibber.

Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.

Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?

Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....

And Jim.

Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.

Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.

You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.

You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.

We don't know anything about it

Well?

Taste it. Why don't you taste it?

When do you think you'll get leave again?

You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.

What is it, pet?

Now take deep breaths, and push.

Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...

Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.

Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?

She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'

Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?

It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.

God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.

I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.

Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.

Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.

Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?

Tiny's home.

Who's your Daddy!

I'd like to see that.

Why? You gonna do something about it?

No, really.

But if you did.

If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.

I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.

Yeah.

Oh yeah, I remember now.

I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.

Really fucking awesome.

I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?

Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.

She looks like she stinks.

What was that?

Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?

Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.

Honk at him. Scare him.

We'll need pictures of the inside too.

Forget it. I'll just go.

Check this out.

Drive through it!

I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.

Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.

Goddamn.

Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.

Fuck your grandmother.

Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?

Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.

Hey, maybe she knows where this is?

Yeah?

Really, now is not the time to make waves.

What are you laughing at?

You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.

Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?

Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.

Rise and shine.

Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.

She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.

Excuse me, may I please use your phone?

A couple hours!

What'd we here, Georgie?

What'd ya got there?

Oh, right.

So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?

I'm gonna go ask him.

Where is he?

Fuck you, you fucking freak!

Thank you.

What should I do?

Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?

Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?

Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.

Mr. Willis?

Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.

Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.

What about the body you found?

Your Spidey senses tingling.

You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.

Hulk was dumb as shit.

You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.

And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.

That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.

No. Don't be silly. It's just...

Thank you so much for accompanying me.

Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.

Is everything fine?

Shall we close up, then?

It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?

Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.

I am sleepy.

Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.

What is wrong, my darling?

Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?

You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.

I love you so much, Gabrielle.

You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.

Well?

Please. I look a mess.

Anyway. Come already to the point.

Nice night.

Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.

I don't get that. Is that sexual?

Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.

Go the fuck away, Rosie.

As do I.

No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.

I'm sorry about my parents.

Shaving cream?

Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.

Did you see that?

No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.

You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?

What are you doing in there?

I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...

Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?

Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.

Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!

Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.

Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!

Bravo to you, Puff!

You just have to control it. We're not apes.

Nah. You just relax. How's the book?

Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.

Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.

Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!

Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.

Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.

Thanks to you, Nate.

Unn.

Puff, put the gun down.

Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.

Mother?

Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.

Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.

It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?

You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?

Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?

And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?

How much?

How much do I owe you?

Hey, mister.

You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?

That's your problem.

First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.

Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.

Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.

Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.

How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.

I never saw you do anything else.

No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.

What happened to you anyway?

Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.

Fine.

You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.

They're fine.

I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.

Please don't get off me now.

So you figure you're still my manager, huh?

Maybe. You want to play?

Who's he?

Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?

Yeah, that's right.

He's my partner.

You got that wrong, mister. I am.

Well... well, now.

Hey, how much are we ahead?

Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.

You don't need a drink.

What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?

Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.

Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?

This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?

With what?

C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.

Yeah, to play Fats again.

You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?

I thought we came here to play pool.

There it is. I'm broke.

Here.  Been an interestin' evening.

Gimme ten bucks.

You quittin', friend?

How long you been waiting?

What time does the bus leave?

Have a nice trip.

Can I sit down?

Eddie. The name is Eddie.

I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.

What time is it?

I'm hungry.

Oh, cut my finger.

What happened?

You glad?

For how long?

Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?

Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.

I hear you've been looking for me.

Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.

Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.

...you shoot a great game of pool.

Are you all right?

Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.

Yes.

Do you still want me to stay?

Shhh... don't talk.

It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.

I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.

Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.

Why, Dad?

There are more this year than last.

Which one's that?  The dull, red one.

Jim -- what's wrong?!

Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --

I had an awful dream.

It was so real, Dad.

I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.

What happened to you?  Who was that?

What's wrong, Ellen?

Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.

We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.

What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?

Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.

This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?

Where, Jimmy?

This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.

I swear it was here.

Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.

Did you call the State Police?

When?

His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.

Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?

I wish I could do more but we're moving out.

This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.

And when is the countdown supposed to expire?

David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.

Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.

I don't know how you put up with him.

There's good news and bad news.

You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.

I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.

Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?

David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...

You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?

Dad, please...

Pops, you're a genius!

I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.

Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?

What're you doing?

Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?

Where are they?

How're we doing?

Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?

That's impossible...

With their shields down it might be possible.

It's doing what?

Dick-weed!

So, what do you do for a living?

Stop it.

But I gave you some this morning.

Just what the hell do you think you're doing?

It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.

I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.

Call them back.

Can they be killed?

Why did you people come here?

Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?

All my life!

How's the head?

Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.

Henry, the pen --

Look what you did!

The Word of God...

Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!

Where did this come from?

Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.

Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.

My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

Bingo.

Except he's lost, and I'm not.

Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.

Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?

Don't wander off.

I said go around!

At least I let you tag along.

Knock it off. You're not mad.

This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

I'll never forgive myself --

Well, what was left of him.

...you did it.

You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?

Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!

What am I looking for?

Dad!

What?

This is intolerable!

Three devices of such lethal cunning.

Marcus would agree with me.

Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.

We didn't talk. We never talked.

Well... I can't think of anything.

Now, who are all these people?

Dad?!

Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.

What did you find, Junior?

I like Indiana.

The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.

That car belonged to my brother-in- law.

Where's my father?

All right! Where's my father

Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".

Interested in local curios?

I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?

I believe we're being called to dinner.

Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --

Hard to believe, isn't it...?

He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".

Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.

We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.

There, you see, Captain. A rock!

Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.

You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.

Now what about the antidote, Lao.

You got the tickets, Short Round?

Indy?

Indy, look!

He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.

Come one, what's wrong?

Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!

Give me the stones!

The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.

Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.

You will find them when you find sivlalinga.

So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?

I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.

What do you mean -- how?

Dream -- nightmare is more like it.

And then they took their children.

Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!

What's happening?

Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...

The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.

It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.

I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.

Couldn't keep away, huh?

That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!

Not leftovers?

Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...

No -- don't you see -- crawling --

WILLIE?!

Wait -- what're you doing?

You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!

What?

I want to go home...

What're we going to do?!

This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.

Figures...

Where are you,...Al?

Try me.

Arrrgh!

Who was it?

Who?

You're in my head...

Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.

Quit screwing around, this is important.

Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.

What for?

Are you crazy?

You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.

You'll be alive.

I'll talk to them.

I'll tell you what to say.

Anyone there?

Now what?

I wouldn't say that.

Why? AL  You know too much.

What do you mean we.

That's not a good idea.

I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.

I'm back.

What do we do?

I don't have any.

It's illegal.

I'll get in trouble.

They'll know who I am.

It's just not enough.

Oh yeah, to what?

Now what?

The beach?

Do you notice anything.

Swim.

You're beautiful..

What do I do?

.

Where is she staying?

It worked.

They both look good to me.

I feel like an idiot.

Which one?

Even Rene?

What is it?

It's embarrassing.

You got any books in there?

What Happened?

Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..

And on my time.

Better. I found Ryuji.

Osaka.

`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.

Door to the right. Get up and run.

What?

I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.

It's him.

Are you alright?

Aim just in front of his face.

There's a lot you don't know.

Pretty advanced, isn't it?

Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.

You were the one who was always suspicious of her!

I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.

You're a lucky man.

In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.

JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?

I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.

You just got a Mickey.

Doesn't matter.

We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?

You've cut your hair?

How about a deal?

Surveillance Cameras?

That crazy guy?

I don't want to intrude.

It is to me too.

...Foreign service.

You may not remember things.

When you remember...

Take the card.

Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?

Ahhh...nothing.

Sue who?

And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?

What did you say?

Blake said that?

What way?

You mean from it.

You again.

I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..

Why did you leave?

Why did you stay with me?

Why did they leave?

He didn't.

He stole something. From a friend of mine.

We're very close.

You don't believe me.

And you?

If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?

Chiang Cho?

What did you tell them?

What?

How?

Don't worry.

Must be a fulfilling occupation.

We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.

Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.

That's alright. Just tear it apart.

This the only spare?

Screw the PEM...What about Al...

It'l take months.

Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.

Hey, baby. What's wrong?

When's your deadline?

What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?

What was that about?

The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!

His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.

Come again?

Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?

How prominent? What kind of placement?

Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.

Hello?

I can take her.

Is there any more rice...?

What do you need at the store?

Please don't wash your hands in the sink.

Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"

Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.

Is it too late?

Area code 212-555-0199.

...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?

Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?

...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...

Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...

Oh, man.

It went great in Mississippi, Mike.

I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.

In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...

Mike... in my...

That Canada story? Still interest you?

C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...

Coffee?

How have you liked your stay?

Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?

Did work.

How much would I get paid?

Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?

C'mere. I want to talk to you.

I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...

You believe that?

No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!

Jeff, call the FBI right away...

I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...

You attract a crowd.

What's changed?

No? No, what?

Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?

That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?

That's not the point.

You manipulated me into this...!

Just give me an example...

Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...

Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?

And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...

Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.

The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...

Object to the form!

Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.

Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?

And how is Mrs. Reiser?

Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?

No!

And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.

Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.

Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.

What the hell is Botox?

It was a gift from a client.

She can't really love that idiot, can she?

I have it.

He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.

She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.

Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --

These are yours.

Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.

Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.

Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?

"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"

All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?

Getting married.

He's passionate.

No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.

I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.

Marylin? When did I say...?

Screw you, asswipe!

I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?

Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --

You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.

Oh. And that is -- mom?

And here I thought my mother was...

Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.

Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?

No.

Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.

You don't like me?

I don't believe you have "things."

STUFF.  Got a light?

Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.

Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.

I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --

Sweet.

Rex. Get away from the door.

Are you alright? You lost weight.

Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?

I'm sorry. Where were we?

Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?

Miles Massey.

Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.

You're not...

Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.

Well, that's about to change big time.

Soon, you'll have your own rage!

So, Ruth. How's Sam?

He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --

He never ate the pre-nup, did he!

Where does that leave us?

Time marches on. Ardor cools.

Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.

In anticipation of making you sick.

What do you think?

No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.

Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.

It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.

How is she?

What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!

We'll go into that some other time.

I might.

Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.

What've you got against King Westley?

Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.

A time will come when you'll thank me for this.

You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?

Well, if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to

Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?

What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?

Why; naturally, I

Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.

What happened?

Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.

Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?

No.

Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 

That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.

Oh, yeah?

Oh, yeah?

Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will.

Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?

That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?

I never thought of that.

If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.

Here, boy!

Of course I do. What do you mean

Now, just a minuteyou can't

Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.

This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 

That, I suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right.

You've got a name, haven't you?

Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.

Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.

High time you got back.

Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.

Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.

Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!

It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.

Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 

After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.

I better go over and see her.

I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?

I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?

Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?

Yeah.

This isn't "piggy-back."

What!

I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.

Really?

Here comes a car!

What're you going to do?

Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?

You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.

What about money?

Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited

No, it isn't. I'm hungry andand scared.

Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.

I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed  Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tiredand it's the only thing around.

No harm in your coming to see us.

Here's your ticket, ma'am.

Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.

But I don't go in for that kinda stuffmuch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 

Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.

I've been thinking about you.

I'm hungry.

I said, the old man's screwy!

Joe, listen

What's the thousand bucks for?

What!

I'd put you there myself.

Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?

Yeah, where am I?

All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.

What?

There you gotrustin' people again. How many times did I tell you

I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!

See that. They're gone!

Not a minute!

What's the idea?

Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.

It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?

I can use a smart guy like you.

Yeahthe "big boy"the Boss of the outfit.

Got a couple of kids, huh?

Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.

And Oswald?

So you saw Oswald how many times?

Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?

All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.

A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.

You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.

I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.

What do you think, Lou?

Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.

You know you keep saying that.

Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.

But why?

I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.

Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?

Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.

...and have you ever met David Ferrie?

Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?

In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.

I believe the boys got a couple.

Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.

Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?

Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.

What about Ruby?

They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.

I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.

Daddy!  Where have you been?

He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:

I want the truth.

Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.

No.  Never heard of him.

Who?

Let me show you his picture. 

Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?

Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.

In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...

This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...

I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.

One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.

Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?

Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.

Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?

Hi.

My sympathies.

Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.

He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.

I know David - a strange character.

...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?

I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.

Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.

You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.

Time?

That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.

I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?

You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.

There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?

Are they?  Why would they?

I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.

I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?

Well, thanks for coming.

...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.

Why did Guy beat you, Jack?

Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.

Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.

I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.

They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...

I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?

I need some information from you then.  How old are you?

Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?

Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?

I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?

I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.

You were there for me.

You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.

Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --

I ain't gittin' in that trunk.

Look, man, I know I owe you --

Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?

Why were you with him?

What's she willing to give us?

Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?

Would I mind? Do I have a choice?

Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.

I'm not a loser.

My pocketbook.

How was your flight?

I can give you a lift home if you'd like?

That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.

Same as you. Ten thousand.

But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.

What, I couldn't hear you?

I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.

You never got into the whole CD revolution?

Who is this?

You're gonna offer to set him up?

I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?

Really?

My ass ain't the same.

Fifteen thousand.

He was here?

You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.

What do you do when he comes home?

I'm not sure you answered my question.

How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?

Ray wants him.

I never lied to you.

We're partners.

Wanna go?

Who's side are you on?

What if I plead guilty?

Oh, Miss Brown?

No shit. You know how he makes his money?

How can you help us?

I'm recording this.

The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...

It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.

Uh-huh.

Yes. All those things are true.

That would be one point of view.

How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?

I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.

What did you do after that?

Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.

Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.

You already knew that?

You think I'm kidding?

It looks good on you.

What do you think it is?

Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.

I got a problem...

Didja tell 'em anything else?

If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.

I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.

I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.

So where did you go?

C'mon, don't lie.

Wanna fuck?

Please.

Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.

What are you doin'?

As low as two.

You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.

Whatcha watchin'?

Guess where I am?

Uh-huh.

I didn't look like a bum.

If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."

Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.

That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --

You shot her twice?

How long was she in there?

You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?

'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.

Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.

They don't have your winning personality.

It's in my bag.

C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.

Who's it for? A relative?

He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.

They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.

Hey, Max.

Brown, Jackie Brown.

Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?

Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.

Where is it?

What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?

That's all?

In a way, yes.

She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.

It's in the safe. She can't get at it.

If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.

It's the next street.

He ain't here right now.

He's around.

Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.

I'm alive.

I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.

Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.

Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.

It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.

Hello.

What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?

Well, try, huh.

Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.

Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?

Daddy, what was that noise?

Doctor.  Ph.D.

I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.

Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.

He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.

Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.

From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.

Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.

And how is your wife? Sarah, no?

Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?

I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.

Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.

Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?

I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.

The room!

It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?

What happened to you?

Did you look around the headboard?

Eli. Why can't you remember their names?

Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.

New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.

Oh, come on. It's early.

Why? What for?

Can't you stop it?

Look at me. I'm ice cold.

Don't gimme that.

Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!

You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?

Remember that.

Who else were you expecting?

Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?

Who was that?

It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.

This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.

Please.

WHO ARE YOU?

I don't know you.

What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?

Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?

Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?

This isn't happening.

Oh God!

TELL ME, DAMN YOU!

So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.

No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.

Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.

None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?

How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?

How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.

No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.

That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.

Please come quietly.

I'm sorry.

That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.

What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?

Can I help you?

Is he all right?

I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?

Asshole that does not count as a kill.

Duck fuckers?

What's that?

Can we blow it with just two?

Nice touch.

You see that?

Shit!

Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!

Then what do we do?!

Earth II.

I'm with you kid.

I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.

I need to know what you know about this guy.

Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.

You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!

Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?

Pull me in!

You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.

Rizzo, he's out there.

Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.

Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!

We're screwed!

Rizzo?!

See? We're not so bad.

You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.

Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?

Spunky . . .

That's really funny.

We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.

Now hold on! We should hear her out!

Yuck.

It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!

He's trying to ask you out on a date.

Push off toward us.

Now this is getting exciting.

I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.

I'm gonna spew.

YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.

You're so bossy.

Jesus!

Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?

I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.

No.

I don't know...sorry?

The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.

I don't understand...what does he want?

Something's wrong.

You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?

We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.

More soldiers?

How do you open the damn door?

Can we get through these?

And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.

And incidental damages, if any...

And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.

Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.

I never saw one that big.

Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...

Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.

He's chasing us! I don't believe it.

He's comin' up -- !

How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?

Right.

The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?

Don't forget these.

It's three feet deep, Martin

It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.

You too, sweetheart...

Now tell me something I don't know.

He lost it on the way up.

We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.

I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.

Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?

Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?

Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.

Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?

Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?

There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...

Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?

...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.

What's that?

How can you tell?

If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.

What happened?

You all right?

A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!

You here for the summer?

We're not even sure what it was.

Leg of lamb this time?

Going out on the 'Aurora.'

Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.

I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?

Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.

Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?

Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

That's pilot whale, isn't it?

Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!

Over there!

I'll drink to your leg.

...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.

Coming right to us!

Follow him!

Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?

You ran eight miles today, Puppy.

Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.

Hey Bleek.

When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.

Well! Nothing like experimenting.

Charisma?

Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.

So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.

Is that normal?

Well, we were once. You know, that time.

Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?

You know it's okay.

What, you mean as friends?

I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.

Wait, what's that supposed to mean?

Nails? Really?

Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?

Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.

I have no idea how to spit this out.

No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.

Oh, God...

But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.

You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?

Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?

When was this, like '96?

Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.

Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.

Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.

Like what?

You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?

Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.

Junk?

We definitely want it to have junk.

Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...

Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?

Uh, thanks.

I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.

I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.

Cool.

Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!

You do?

Only squares and nerds go to dances.

A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.

You should try Adderall.

Can I take your coats?

Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?

The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.

Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.

Oh my God...

Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.

Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.

Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.

Juno? What's going on?

Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.

You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...

Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?

Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.

I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.

Hi Dad.

Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.

I'm losing my faith in humanity.

I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.

Please stop now.

Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!

Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!

How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?

So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?

Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?

Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.

All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."

Touche.

Aw, please Junebug?

How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?

I wish my funbags would get bigger.

Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.

I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.

Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.

You don't say.

You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.

That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.

Juno, what's the matter?

What did you do?

What?

She answered our prayers.

What would be a good time for you?

I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.

...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.

One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...

Better not, or Early'd whip me.

Your pictures. Can I see 'em?

That's me.

Happy birthday Adele.

Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...

Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.

...thank you.

...I don't know.

Where you from Walter?

Never heard of it, any huntin'?

...Mind if I hold that Bible?

Brian.

Sure.

Yeah?

Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?

...Well then, that's how many I killed.

So tell me... what happened here?

You two been busy in here.

Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.

The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.

Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.

What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."

I like that.

We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...

Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?

Up yours.

I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?

I can't believe I agreed to do this.

Carrie... stop it.

Carrie, watch for Early.

Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?

Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?

...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...

You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.

...Janitor's job.

His Parole Officer.

Could be.

...Diebold?

How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?

Were they wearing condoms?

You're clean.

I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.

Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.

That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.

Shit.

Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.

You wanna go to Paul's house?

You thirsty?

And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.

Darcy. Benny's little sister.

Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.

I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.

I don't understand why you do that.

Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.

Casper.

Casper, where is he?

You goin'?

You sure?

Man we fucked him up.

Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?

What?

Yeah. Come on.

Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.

I was lookin' for you all day today.

I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.

Uh huh.

No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.

I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.

I just know. I know you'll love it.

Who are they?

This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.

What do I want to do?

Because your a virgin?

Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.

Come dance.

How old are you?

Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.

Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.

You are being ripped open.

You didn't?

Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.

I hate sucking dick!

Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.

Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.

What happened?

Do you know where he went?

Who, Benny's little sister?

Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.

I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?

And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.

I hate 'em.

So that's why Casper is how he is.

No. I was just kidding.

Yeah.

Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever

Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.

You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?

Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.

What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?

Then let's narrow it down.

You're a lying bastard!

What are you talking about?

Take it easy.  Both of you.

The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.

I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.

You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.

Why does he call Sanderson?

What do you mean, stand out?

Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.

To get your attention.

Why did you write remember on the wall?

I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?

But you said you didn't know her.

And you want these girls to feel your pain?

What?

You're next move should have been e2- e3.

Emotional?  I expected more from you.

By that time the game will be over.

That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."

I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!

This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.

Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.

There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...

I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--

It worked out alright, didn't it?

Why did he?

You must be Erica.

That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?

Do you like my dad?

What are you doing up?

There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?

This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.

You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?

His home would be... Mount Olympus.

Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.

Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.

What time did he get there?

Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?

This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.

Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.

Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.

As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.

Answer the question.

Then I'll transpose.

It's a good play, but risky.

What do you see here?

That's a very personal question.

Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?

Well, I think I've had enough.

What are you looking for?

I think it's interesting.

Do you?

What?

What is this?

Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.

This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.

I'm hungry.

Fine.

In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?

The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.

Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.

If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.

How did you know it was "carefully"?

You beat him.

You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.

Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.

We're almost married.

There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.

Colwyn ...

Lyssa ...

Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.

No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.

You have not slept in two days.

She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.

I cannot reach her.

No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.

Yes.

Never.

I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!

From here, I must go alone.

The spiral begins in the west.

She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!

What use is my sword? I can't reach her!

They can be saddled.

I know the cruelty of such a fate.

Let me comfort you.

It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?

Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?

Once is enough, thank you.

Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.

Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.

They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.

And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.

It should be an interesting journey, then.

You've eaten nothing.

We could reach it on fire-mares.

Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.

You!

A venison pie as big as a house.

I'm hungry.

Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.

Passable, pimple, very passable.

He was aiming a huge spear right at me!

They'll trample him to death!

I do not want your power. It is hideous.

It's a lie!

What news from our friends?

Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.

For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.

I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.

A girl of some spirit, your daughter.

You were attacked in the forest?

We seek the Fortress of Krull.

You know the voice.

Knowledge I wouldn't want.

Yes.

Each to his fate, lad.

Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.

It is fifty years since I heard that name.

But you would not stay with me.

You had a son.

The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?

You will come with me.

He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.

Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?

I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?

Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?

...OK.  I love you anyway.

OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?

...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?

It's too big.

Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?

Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!

What do you do, with the money you earn?

How shall we get out now, Leon?

Yes?

Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.

Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.

...Yes?

I'm sick with practicing, that's it...

Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...

...OK... Good.

Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?

It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...

...Who sent you?

I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.

It's impossible.

Are you two planning kids?

Then it'll have to wait until I finish.

The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.

I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...

You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.

You thought I sent them?

Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?

It's a special day isn't it?

Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?

Anything?

I do love you... very, very much.

I want children.

Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --

Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.

Maurice?

Red flag, man.

Red flags man.

I thought you were asleep.

Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.

Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.

Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?

This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.

Tom Joad?

Are they standing?

... My father.

Where did he go?

I really want that watch.

Water?

Hello!

That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.

What's up?

I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.

This is the home of an angel.

I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.

First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?

Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?

Sera... what you don't understand is...

Hi!

No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.

Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.

I don't understand any of that.

Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.

I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.

Will you lighten up, please?

What did they look like?

About ready for another drink?

Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.

You have been lonely?

Have you told anyone that I'm here?

Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.

What alibi?

I loved him!

Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.

I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!

It's so shameful...

That's just it -- it would ruin me!

No.

Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.

But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?

So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?

Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?

Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?

How many, would you say?

Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?

Huh?

Why the hell not?

You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.

We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?

I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.

Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?

You can't go home!

Uh -- family.

Our group is full.

Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.

I'm a bitch.

You're pawning The Rock?!

I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!

Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?

Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.

And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.

Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?

Why?

Mrs. Windham Vandermark?

Okay, how would it work?

Back up. How do you know he's gay?

But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --

Oh, he is so over on this campus.

How could this happen?

Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?

What?

I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.

His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.

You don't really believe she's innocent?

Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?

Wow. You're a walking felony.

You look -- nice.

So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.

Hovering?

What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?

Let's all go! Road trip!

You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.

You go?  Not watch fun?

Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.

We go out, smash 'em now?

Birdies... pretty...

We watch... good fun...

More fun win battle?

When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!

Might we watch, too?

It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...

Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.

An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?

Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.

So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.

It's bluebells!

You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.

I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.

Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?

But... but, why?

Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?

Don't you know?

The princess is dead.

A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.

What is it?

I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?

Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."

This is ogre's magic.

Good.

I pray always to be worthy of it.

... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...

Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!

Never felt so cold in all me born days...

Give in to despair and all is lost.

There's more than one way to spring a trap.

That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.

He'll be atop the portculis ere long.

Nonsense!  Course it matters.

Can't we move any faster?

She lives... isn't that worth singing about?

Aye... my Lord...

How're these?

These for me?

But you did... you did!

Liar!

Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?

A gentleman would offer water.

I detest serpents.

I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.

How much longer?

Jack!

I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.

Who?

My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.

Lili!  No!

Sunlight?

Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.

Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.

You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!

I can't see a thing.

We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.

Step lively now!

What's this now?

Where do I find the Baron's castle?

Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.

Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.

This is sad news, be it true.

Tis not the time to speak of cheer.

As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.

In every way.

You are fair as the first new flower of spring...

Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.

Nay, Oona, tis not possible.

Please...

What's she doing?

Lost?

Let that be our problem, just get us there.

Are you going to see Sam again?

You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.

Did you know him before you knew Dad?

Mom?

I'm going to bed.

Atonement.

He must.

I'm living here while I build another house.

What's today?

I had them in my pocket.

I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?

It's not what I was expecting.

You should stay.

I wanted him to marry her.

Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?

What's the point of this?

You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.

He's at work while I'm here.

This is such a street of whiners.

Are you guys' friends?

Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?

All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.

I've been here twenty years.

Well, it's the least I can do.

I didn't recognize you!

Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.

Is Alyssa here?

This has got to stop!

Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?

You'll have to explain that to the police.

Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?

Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.

I'm not going!

Probably in the bible.

What are you doing?!

When are you going to be back?

Where is it?

I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!

I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.

I'll have to pay him back.

I know the feeling.

What are you now?

I know parts of who you are.

What would you be doing now?

I'm proud of you, Sam.

Are you talking?

After everything.

She seemed upset.

I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?

I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.

No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.

It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.

It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.

Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?

What are you doing?

He never answers.

Kurt's been feeding him.

I need to talk to you.

Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.

I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.

I drove over and you were gone.

We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.

With your hands or your tongue?

You brought your kids?

It's been a while.

Let's see if you've gotten any better.

When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.

I'm married.

Peter left me yesterday.

I could die.

What's your deal with Alyssa?

I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.

I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.

I can't go right now.

I was talking about our marriage.

That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?

Where are the kids?

Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.

You don't look like you.

Do you know anything about building a house?

I guess I could teach you some things.

What are you doing in my room?

Queer.

I brought a few of my own.

Adam, that's not true!

Go tell your father we're eating.

We get the games on the radio sometimes.

Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.

Married?

You know, go to the tonk or whatever.

Want me to come back some other time?

I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.

You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?

You know I trust you, Claude.

Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?

I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.

For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.

Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?

I've never seen you in here before.

Can't you remember your own name?

Don't I know you?

Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.

Start your job? What kind of job?

I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.

My daddy gave me this watch.

Reward?

Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.

She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...

I wouldn't do that if I was you.

You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.

What does that mean?

Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --

Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.

The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?

Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.

No.

You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!

Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.

You get ketchup?

Crawfords.

You show them Crawfords how to play ball.

Crop duster.

I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.

You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?

What the hell are you doing?

Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.

Back to New York for starters.

Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.

I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.

I can't do it.

Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?

No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.

I know you're not talking to me...

Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.

All in, boss!

That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

Where am I at, man?

Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.

Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.

Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.

They gave me life, mama.

You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!

If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.

Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.

He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.

Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?

Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.

I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.

Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?

That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.

What are you in for, Willie?

Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?

I'm interested. Keep talking.

If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.

He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.

Is this a joke?

"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.

No!

Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?

It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?

A mountain goat? That's really sweet.

What's Nicky doing down there?

They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.

My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.

You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.

All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.

I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.

I didn't murder anybody

Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?

Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.

I got no ears! I can't hear!

Check one-two. Check one-two.

Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.

No. This can't be happening.

Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?

Bus?

No wonder your uncle's so weird...

His name is Andrew. I know that guy.

No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.

So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...

I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!

Hello.

Adrian?

You think I'm a tourist?

Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.

It's freezing my hands.

Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.

You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.

Valerie?

We're going to Jersey?

Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?

A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.

That just hurt a lot.

And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?

For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!

What other food?

Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.

That was a great shot you made.

I just might look in on New You 483 myself.

I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.

Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.

When do you go up?

What's wrong, Available?

Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.

Yes... probably he was renewed?

You could have called me yourself.

Of course.

Why tell me?

About running, dying what?

I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...

What're you going to do?

I wish I could help you.

I'd rather be with you.

They're like beasts. Wild.

I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.

I -- I can't.

I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?

Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.

What's that?

You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.

...But I still have the choice...?

There's a Sanctuary... there is!

What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?

We can't. We're going back.

You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?

We'll have to bury him.

I'll make the arrangements.

Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...

Goodbye.

We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.

How long have you been living here?

How did you get here?

But there may be a few around somewhere.

My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?

They're beautiful. May I have one too please?

Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?

Can you make it back?

Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.

Well? How do you like it?

Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?

You want somethin'?

You're a musician?

No.

Like you'd get if it was hand held.

You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.

How would you like to take me to dinner?

I want more.

Hello.

He'll kill us.

Have you partied with him?

You like it?

What deal?

What's he do?

Pornos.

I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?

You got him.

Where's the bathroom?

Andy, who is that guy?

But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?

What night is that?

Sheila?

Then he's coming home with his mother and me.

We saw you that night, Pete.

Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?

That's not Fred Madison?

I want to see him.

No.

There's no other bedroom?

Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.

You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?

Who's it from?

When you didn't come to the club.

Don't you want to watch it?

We will.

No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.

They're gonna cook him.

I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 

I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.

Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.

At sixty?

If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.

Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...

Mr. Eddy?

You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?

I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?

What's goin' on?

What are you guys doin'?

Where'd you come from?

I didn't know you cared.

Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.

A what?

I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.

Found in Asia!

Uh-huh.

Don't call me brother.

I say, good morning, Lovey.

I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.

Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.

Something tells me this means food. Come on!

Thinking? What about some double solitaire?

Have I?

You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.

Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?

Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!

I say, will you have a cigarette?

Hey - look!

You mean you don't want to go?

I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?

Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.

That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?

Well, they didn't actually mean that.

And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?

Yes. I'm afraid it does.

You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?

You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]

Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "

Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.

Oh, thank you. Thank you!

You're lying, aren't you?

I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.

It's astonishing - and incredible, but

You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!

That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.

Sondra Bizet.

Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.

You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.

I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.

He's dead.

I don't know.

George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?

Porters?

For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of

It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?

George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?

What's she got to do with it?

Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.

I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!

What is?

Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.

You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?

Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.

Would you like to wring my little neck?

Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?

What do you want him to do?

What is it?

Why, he's speaking English.

How about you? Do you want to go?

You'll wait till you rot!

EXCUSE ME

We have one motto: Peace on Earth.

They don't?

You think we're nuts.

Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?

So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.

Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?

Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--

'Hell, I may as well do something useful.

Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.

Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.

I know, but we're on a college campus...

I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.

I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.

I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.

What?

A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.

Something's wrong here.

Looks like a train ticket.

It's marble.

Would you call this a code 100?

I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...

Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!

I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?

Sure.

So... how'd you hear about this?

Right, right-- I like that stuff.

It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?

What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?

Your licence is revoked. Permanently.

Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?

Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?

In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.

We need to talk to you about the alien.

Which way?

Really nice wheels, by the way.

He's gone, too.

Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.

Hard to tell.  I hope not.

Yeah?  What's up?

Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?

A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.

What?

Take it.

Oh, God...

I have to go back.

I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.

John?  What is it?

Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.

Kill type?

I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.

And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?

If he's looking for a flaw in the system --

Lara called me.

You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.

Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --

I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.

You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --

John.  Please.  Listen to me --

No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.

What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.

Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.

You don't have to do this, Chief.

Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.

Uh-huh.  Jad?

Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?

The victim's name is Leo Crow.

But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?

To them.

I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.

But you call this room the "temple".

Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.

Just go to the beginning!

Sean -- you're not real.

What the hell.

I wanted to.

Who are you?

It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --

You're not gonna kill me?

Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --

I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.

What about the picture --

Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.

Just what is it you think I can do for you?

It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.

What?

Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?

You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?

You want to bring it down.

Where?

Which one is that?

Oh, God, what did you do?

It's insanity around here.

John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."

I understand.

You have an emergency call on your private line.

He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?

It's the same prevision.

I'm thinking someone got away with murder.

Precog Deja Vu...

So there is a way to fool the system?

Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --

What?

Can't they shut that off?

Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".

There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.

I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?

He looks familiar.

We could have lunch together.

This your work?

I like it.

Cream and sugar.

Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?

That was our apartment.

He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...

They've never been separated before.

Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.

Yeah, snifters are for cognac --

...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.

Not on me, sir.

Are you sure?

What, sir?

It's on West Broadway.

Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...

Oh no. What is it this time.

It's a poison arrow tree frog.

Uncle Bobby?

Honey?

No. What kind of bachelor party?

Oh, please.

Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --

Well, that's not gonna happen.

No coke tonight.  Right?

Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.

No way that cocksucker's driving you.

Your dance is over.

What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?

What's his name?

Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?

It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.

Where's Ricky?

It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.

A million. Easy.

I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?

Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.

It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.

I got a way we make everybody happy.

Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.

That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.

I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...

You want --

What's that?

No. Just the cross streets.

We're with Ruiz.

We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?

That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --

How am I being shitty?

I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.

I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?

This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.

Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.

I gotta pick up the baby.

No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --

Holy shit. Can you believe this?

Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.

C'mon, man...

How much is it?

Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.

Oh really. Why's that?

I know you're not calling Jimmy.

What exactly did they say?

Nothing else.

Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...

He woulda told us right?

Why you gotta make everything difficult?

Where do you think you're going?

Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.

He wants to see us now.

Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.

I'm pretty sure we do.

Wanna bet?

Float me a hundred bucks.

What about it?

Dude, we were practically made...

Cardiff Giant?

How much is what?

Yes.  Would you care for another one?

How do you know it's not drugs?

Ow, shit...

Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.

Coke?

No, really, mate?

Yeah.

Yeah.

A lot of Persians?

Don't worry. I get it.

We're square.

We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.

What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.

What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?

No...

When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?

Edinburgh.

Dip?

I'll get it.

Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.

Keeps me out of the army.

Is your papa West Indian?

It hit?

Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.

Shit, what else she gonna say?

Let Billie finish.

Take it easy, baby.

Why? Why does everybody conk?

Leggo. I got to wash it out.

I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.

Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.

Where am I gonna start?

Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.

Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.

You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.

Little.

I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.

I can't.

I'll have it tomorrow.

Is the program ready?

What?

What points?

Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.

Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.

At a gas station.  Will you marry me?

I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.

Why are you looking at me like that?

I just want to sit here and be still.

To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?

Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!

A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.

What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.

Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?

What color were the original Hebrews?

Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?

She know?

Is she hooking?

The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --

'Lo. I've got to freshen up.

It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --

Did you hear me?!

Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.

Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?

To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.

Let me die then.

You're my father.

Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.

You will, baby -- if the time come.

Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.

I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.

Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.

So? The man got silver, china, rugs --

You want to be the head man?

Head nigger in charge?

Who the hell are they?

Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.

The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.

You have no interest in making things easy, do you?

Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.

[Why?]

A lot of people are looking for you.

I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.

[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]

[What money?]

[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]

[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]

[Do you know who I am?]

[How much do you want?]

[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]

[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]

[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]

[Yes. Many times.]

[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]

You got a secondary search and you had a gun.

So how's business?

But don't you stay in El Paso?

Stomach's gone. But... okay.

Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?

Where are you from, Creasy?

Potential? I don't understand.

There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?

I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?

How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?

Doesn't matter. I always finish second.

What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?

I'm not afraid you, Creasy.

I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.

You're American.

Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?

They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.

Creasy... Wait.

If she pisses you off, you get another one.

[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]

You should be sleeping, baby.

Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.

I like him, Mom.

I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.

He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.

He has to go, Samuel.

[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]

[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]

[You only fuck me to get information.]

Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.

You helped him get this job.

He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.

I told you she wasn't attractive...

Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...

So waddaya feel like doing tonight?

That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.

Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?

There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.

Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.

I didn't think she was so bad-looking.

I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?

We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.

Oh.

That's my son Thomas's baby.

You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.

Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.

Wadda you think?

I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.

Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.

Marty...

The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.

So I'll call you tomorrow.

No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.

You say something?

What?

Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?

I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.

Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?

Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.

Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.

Sure. This girl said...

Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.

Oh, we got plenny-a room here.

So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?

Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.

Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.

How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?

Did you offer the young lady some fruit?

That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...

She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.

What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.

I don't like her.

I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.

So these two girls come over to the bar...

I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...

...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.

Waddaya mean, Ralph?

When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.

Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?

Sure.

Well...

Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.

Okay.

What do you want me to do?

Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.

Yes, O'Reilly?

Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?

Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?

You  must  open  me  up  again?

This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.

What?

What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?

Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore   House. You in the market Duke?

Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.

Never mind. Forget it.

Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...

Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.

Any time. Whenever we want.

Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.

There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.

Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.

...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...

If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.

You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.

The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!

Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?

Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?

Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.

I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?

It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.

Look.

Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.

It's in pretty deep.

Christ, it's Ho-Jon!

Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.

I don't feel anything.

I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.

It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?

So what makes you think he'll play for us?

Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.

That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.

What's the matter?

See you.

Our minds?

I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.

Dear, sweet Hawkeye.

You're on his side all of the sudden?

How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?

A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?

At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.

Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!

Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?

No, never in the slightest.

How much time do I have?

Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?

The blonde dish.

Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.

You don't aim to cause any trouble  But?

We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.

About that chest-cutter...

It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.

Yes, that's what I mean.

What's wrong with you?

Sir?

Splendid, sir. No problems.

Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.

Morning, girls. Good morning Major.

Yeah?

Action?

Who?

Oh. Yeah.

Uh-huh . . .

Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.

Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?

Ted Sheldon.

How much money do you get?

Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?

Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.

Better let me talk to him.

Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?

Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!

The letter from John Doe.

Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.

What John Doe?

That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!

Okay, sister, you get your job back.

So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?

And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.

How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?

Have you seen him?

No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!

I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.

Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?

Hello! . . . Yeh?

Who's got him?

Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?

Ba-ll!

You don't have toWhy, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .

A what?

Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.

Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!

I trust him.

Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.

Now, that's all right, isn't it?

If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.

Oh, just traveling through, huh?

What difference does that make?

Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started

Flowers.

Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!

Not that we know of.

Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.

Where's the stereo?

Apartment 306.

What's the line?

God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.

You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.

Don't make do it, Mike.

The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.

Manual or automatic?

You signed out twice.

Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.

Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?

I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.

You can't kill me like this.

Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.

Recruited you from where?

How are we gonna get him out of there?

Come on. Let's go for a drink.

You have to. It's a tradition.

That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.

First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?

Tell me what you need.

If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.

I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.

We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.

The 6 horse is last.

To run last?

He's got the girl.

You're crazy.

Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?

Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.

Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?

Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.

Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.

A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?

I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.

I wanted to get this out of the way.

What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.

Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.

You like this place?

Stay here, don't move.

I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.

You crazy? With all those people around?

Tell him to give me a raise.

There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.

It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.

Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.

You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.

The car is part of the deal.

Roper...

There are two million people in there with you.

They have nothing to do with this --

She said I have a son...

You were right.

It's all here...

But this is impossible.

The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.

With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --

And what about the reconfiguration?

Where you plugged-in from?

He had access to the keys --

You're jumping to conclusions.

Corporate fingerprints all over it.

What is it?

Need the disk back!

What brings you inside?

You went to my high-school?

Then how do you know about --

That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.

But I don't know anything about programming.

What?

But you were with me.

Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?

Why not?

Voice activate.

Program name?

It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.

He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.

... What's happening to him?'

I can hardly walk...

Let's teach these vermin a few manners.

1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!

To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.

By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.

Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!

It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.

I am the wolf, cunning and swift!

NINJA CRANE ZORD!

All systems go!

That's the only way to the Monolith...

Two thirty three a.m.

The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.

There goes the neighborhood.

GET OFF ME!

Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.

THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!

Mordant, go with them and report back to me!

That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!

That was a CHEAP shot!

Anybody see them?

THREE SECONDS!!

There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...

I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.

I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".

Boo-Boo.

Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?

Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.

Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.

We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.

Shane was a friend of yours?

It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.

Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?

No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?

You here with Bobby?

What's the matter?

Charlie?

I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.

Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.

Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.

I been thinkin'...

Like Don Maranzano.

Your honeymoon, Meyer?

Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,

We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.

You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.

I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.

So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.

Where we headed?

Boss, I got all the time you need.

MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!

Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.

We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.

One move pardner, and you're a dead man.

Then perhaps you need to know me.

He's an animal!

The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.

Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.

Forget it. That's past.

Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?

Strategy.

Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.

What's it worth to ya, Boss?

Best we got.

Special occasion?

Chasing me - animals - horrible -

Olive or eyeball?

Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.

Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.

Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.

Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...

I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...

Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...

Land of Death. How do I get there?

The monkey, of course. It was his idea.

Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...

Can't you give it to me later?

Look at this! He won't let us leave!

What's the matter?

I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.

Kimmy! What's the matter?

Nothing for him! He's being repressed.

Hypnos?

Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!

Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.

<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??

How'd <u>you</u> get in there?

Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?

Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?

He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.

You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.

You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.

Is there something else I can do for you?

So, what do you think?

I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?

You know that guy in the pictures you saw?

Mother!

I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?

Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!

Who is it?

She's at work.  I'm her mother.

And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.

What happened?

I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?

This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.

I see.  How much?

--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!

And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?

Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.

And while you're at it, get me a bed!

How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!

Oh--that again. Yeah.

Will you go chase an ambulance!

Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!

Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.

Oh--yeah--

Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?

No.

He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--

Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--

I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!

He's batty!

Oh--oh.

*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!

--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!

Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!

Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--

What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.

What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?

Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!

No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.

Yes. Come in.

Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.

Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?

All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--

Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...

I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?

Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.

Ah, now, that's better.

It does!

Mr. President--

I have no defense against forged papers and--

Mr. President! A point of order!

Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--

Fine--

What is it?

The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!

No, gee--I couldn't stay here--

Go ahead--punch.

If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?

You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--

That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--

Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?

We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.

No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?

Letitia.

Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--

I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?

Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?

Hello.

It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.

Well, I guess it's a chance.

Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!

Ah! That's more like it! What?

Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.

Sure.

Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--

That's--that's splendid.

It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.

Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.

I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--

Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.

Ax?

Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?

Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?

I wouldn't wait if I were you.

Joe! You *told* him to!

--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!

My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.

Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!

No?

Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--

Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--

What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?

That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--

Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.

What do you think?

Do I actually *see* this--?

Mr. President...

Senator Paine will state it!

Order!

Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.

He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.

All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.

You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?

You are , aren't you?

You fainted.

Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.

The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.

Sure. I met you.

Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.

Now, what do you see?

You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.

You said I was a lady in distress.

I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.

I've often thought about going back.

He played in the town band, too.

Ready?

Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.

Hello, Mary?

Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.

Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .

Can I have a month's vacation?

Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?

Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!

I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.

Come on, come on!

Fourteen carat?

Is that the best you've got?

Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.

I wish you luck, sir.

Thank heaven.

Newspaperman?

Hang up.

Yeah. A glorified doormat.

Where?

Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie

How do you do.

Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.

I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.

Oh - nothing. No extra charge.

Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?

This afternoon - at four o'clock.

Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?

You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]

Did you see all this stuff in the papers?

Arthur! Who's Arthur?

But what about this "Cinderella Man"?

What about your knocking off for lunch?

Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.

Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.

Why, it's an artistic institution

The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!

Why not?

Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?

Let him alone.

Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!

Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.

Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.

Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.

There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.

Your Honor

I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.

Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?

Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.

Uh-huh.

How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?

What is your name?

Farmer?

Where is your farm?

South Dakota - north?

You mean  by the neck or something?

Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?

Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?

Twenty! What did he do with them?

Yes, sir.

As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.

Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3

Shall I call the police, sir?

What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.

We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.

Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.

But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.

Interesting approach. What was his name?

...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.

I see.

What's that?

Where's your wife, Henry?

I was... never satisfied.

Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.

You remember when I asked you about pornography --

I didn't see you there. Can I help you?

Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?

Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?

No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?

Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?

...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?

Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?

That's a lot of people all at once.

Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?

And the Brocketts?

Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.

...so rich?

Yes, you do, you damn well do.

I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...

Got a license?  But no car?

Can you help Mom?

I think you do.

Well, look who's here...

Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.

Even if you don't think it's real?

Sore throat?

Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.

No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.

Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.

That was really bad, wasn't it?

So whose route is this?

It's all right.

My brother said you were about to fire me.

All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?

First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.

I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.

I guess you saw the show...?

But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.

Will you think about it?

Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.

Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.

There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...

Would you like another beer?

Can I ask you a personal question?

I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.

I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?

Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.

Well, there's Lily.

What?

How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.

Skip, that's not much of a secret.

Did you carry a gun?

Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.

What about it?

This doesn't seem a little... perverse?

Sorry...

I guess that makes sense.

That was a terrible thing.

No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.

I never killed a priest before.

Oh yes, of course.

Now go find me a big stick.

My very good friend! What a surprise.

He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.

Yeah?

It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.

I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.

So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --

The sun turning black.

The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.

Where are they taking him?

You lie.

Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?

Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.

We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.

No?

You were actually at Hamunaptra?

Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."

According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.

Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.

A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.

Something like that.

No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.

Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.

You called me your girl?

I think you were jealous

Got guts, lady.

You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!

Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?

You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.

None taken.

Tough break.

What?

Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!

I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.

The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.

And what's that?

It must have slipped my mind.

What are you doing all alone in the dark?

You two timing psychotic bastard.

And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.

How about... the Savage Six?

The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.

I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?

And the light goes out...

I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".

Hi.

Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.

What's your real name?

I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...

If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.

So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?

Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.

There's just not enough of us.

So what else has Superman got?

This place is built like a fortress.

GET MAD!

He doesn't miss a trick, does he?

Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.

Maybe she's right.

Maybe there was traffic.

He's turned into a completely normal person!

So you're only invisible... to yourself?

We may be getting in over our heads here.

He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.

My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.

I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.

If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.

The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.

Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.

What do you think Napoleon will do?

Ah -- you approve?

I'm glad you like it.

Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.

Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.

Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?

Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.

General Bonaparte?

This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.

Was the trip normal in every respect?

Yes, sir?

Bastia -- and you?

Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.

Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?

The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.

Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.

I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?

Does your mother know you have come?

I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.

Will Alexander be joining us soon?

Oh...?

No -- not as a rule.

Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.

No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.

The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.

It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.

When is she supposed to return?

Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.

Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?

I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.

Were you in love with him?

Were any of them prettier than I am?

Yes -- what is it?

Separate bedrooms?

Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.

Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.

Nothing.  That's all I can say.

You could hear them?

Can you give me a drink, please?

Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?

May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.

You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?

I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.

Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.

Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.

Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.

Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.

Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.

Come in.

On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.

Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.

Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.

No I'm not.

What you mean talk to her?

Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.

Naw, I already ate.

I ain't trying to rob you...

Nobody!

You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.

Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.

This you?

She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!

Just a little.

What's the matter with your girlfriend?

What?

You know what this is?

What we gonna do?

Alright, Roach, see you around.

Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.

You sure you don't wanna stay?

I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.

Huh?

You did all this for me?

I did.  Is that door locked?

I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.

Next time, page me first.

What's the matter?

Nice neighborhood, huh?

Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?

I can't give you your damn money back on this.

Are they still out there?

Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?

I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.

Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?

Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.

What the fuck you looking at?

Shut up!  Both of you right now!

Just do it.

You too big.

What about that ugly dog?

Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.

My back.

Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.

Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.

Aw, no lovin' tonight?

Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.

Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...

I appreciate that.

How do you know that?

It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.

Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!

This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?

This says "invitation only".

This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.

What about the gun?

You get another chance in ten minutes.

What would you do in my place?

How should I...?

How am I supposed to get away?

One thirty. California Ballroom.

But...

Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?

We have to hurry.

Ready?

Can we go now?

Will you promise me that?

What do you do, if I may be so bold?

I said I have to do something.

Please. Something is going to happen...

Mister, what are you dragging me into?

Cover your mouth.

You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.

Well?

Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.

You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.

I don't have to pay you nothin'.

Oh, we'll have to do better than that.

You stole that.

This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!

Where are we going?

I'm not a baby.

It's under control.

Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?

Where is he? Did you lose him?

Get moving.

Foreigners! Fuck!

Yeah.

Come Back.

Put her on.

He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.

No, Ben.

AAA-MENN!

And the Lord told that man --

See ye got two more peeps to your brood.

Icey, I'm worried about Willa.

About Mr. Powell. All of it!

Just went?

Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell

He lied!

If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!

What he needs is a dose o' salts!

Why?

Pearl! You ain't --

To see Dad?

Where are we goin', John?

Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!

Where ye from?

Story, honey? Why, what story?

Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.

What's taking you so long about it?

Now! Where's it hid, honey?

Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!

Nothin'. 

Yes; John's bad.

Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?

That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.

John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.

It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.

She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.

Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!

What are you after them for?

Pearl and John!

Okay, good. She's asleep.

You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?

Hello?

The killer.

Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!

How you plan to do that?

Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!

She dreamed this would happen...

Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?

That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.

Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --

Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --

Tell her I'm not here, tell her...

Had to've done it. No one else was in there.

Maybe god's punishing us all...

Where you think you're going?

Right home after.

Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.

Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.

And then what happened?

What you mean 'all at once'?

Rod says the sweetest things.

No more fights?

Thank you, Comrade.

What is it, Ninotchka?

From Leon.

Good evening, Anna.

Aren't you late?

What are you serving?

An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?

I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.

You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.

No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.

Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.

You feel it, though.

Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.

If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?

It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.

Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...

Misha! Misha!

This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.

Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.

And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."

Good evening, Gaston.

What time have you, Gaston?

I guess it is eight forty-two.

And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.

Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?

I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.

Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.

Is this satisfactory?

Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.

We can wait.

We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...

Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...

You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?

Comrade Buljanoff...

Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.

Bad news?

This is Comrade Kopalski.

Now, monsieur, you have no right...

He is a porter. He wants to carry them.

We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.

I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...

You want me to go in there?

Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?

Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.

Confess what?

You, please.

At what intervals does he whistle?

I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?

Suppress it.

You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?

The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...

Then you don't want me to go there.

What do we do now?

And what is your profession?

You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.

I can't possibly think of a better reason.

Thank you.

I must go.

As a representative of Moscow...

Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!

I always eat here.

Will you smile?

At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.

On which boat?

I wish they had never met.

It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!

I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?

I don't look too foolish?

It's nine o'clock.

Wonderful -- if one could believe it.

Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.

Comrades! Comrades!

And we won't stretch up our arms...

Our salute will be a kiss.

What shall we get? The news!

Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.

...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?

Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?

Hello, Leon!

Oh, Leon!

I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!

He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.

This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!

What did he say?

Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.

Make it ice cold.

Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!

You just told me you hadn't seen her.

That bad?  Old or young?

There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?

Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.

Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?

All right, I'll listen.

She's gone, Leon.

Now, please, Swana.

Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.

Good morning.

I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.

How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.

Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.

Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.

You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!

Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.

You leave me no choice.

I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.

No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.

Well... that's my business, madame.

I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.

Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?

This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?

I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?

Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...

I am sorry... I have to leave.

He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?

I understand that, sir.

Who's gonna tell Mitchell?

Why me?

It's a code or something.

They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.

McCord? ...

Hunt?  Howard Hunt?

Pay him.

It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.

Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.

We can't touch Hoover --

He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.

The country's loving it.

That was civil war.

Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.

Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.

I did?

Fucking hell.

Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?

Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...

Just do what I say, Bob.

No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.

I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...

Where are they?

He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.

If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?

Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.

Sir?

... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?

She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...

... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...

So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...

Because they're not Americans.

We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.

We could leverage Helms.

... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.

We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.

It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...

Mom expects great things from you ...

I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...

President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...

Mr. Castro.

We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.

Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.

No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.

Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.

My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...

We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.

Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?

You're fucking me.

Where'd you find him?

Mein Kampf?

Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.

I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.

Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...

This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.

You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.

That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.

Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.

So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?

How about Kissinger along with him?

We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...

And Dick beat the shit out of them.

Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.

Uh, wait ...

You all right?

You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.

What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.

Hi.

... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?

No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?

But what am I telling the press about Kent State?

No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.

You know, Fred, they sell tickets.

Proud?

And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!

We lost ...

We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.

Thank you, Fidel Castro.

I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.

What are you saying?  What are you talking about?

This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.

Dick, don't...

I'll do it.  No more.

Tomorrow.

Hiding what?

And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.

Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--

What?

Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."

How'd you know I was here.

How many a those things you got now?

Want a cup?

That man that shot you died in prison.

How come're you doin that?

...I don't know what I do feel like.

Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.

Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.

Who's he in trouble with then?

I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.

We goin' in?

...I believe they've done lit a shuck.

Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.

I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?

Yessir.

...This month's checks.

I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.

I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.

I thought it was a car afire.

I mean, would you care to join me.

It ain't even three years we been married.

I got it Mama.

I put it in, Mama.

You gave your word?

That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?

What'd you give for that thing?

Big talk.

Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.

Not we, you. Stay with your mother.

Llewelyn --

Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.

Mama's gonna raise hell.

Hello?

Huh? What is...

...Where's the transponder?

What way would that be?

Yessir.

The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.

Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?

Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.

What kind of tent?

Yessir.

Could I get another room.

That's me.

...What do you do?

Acetylene? Mig? Tig?

Were you in Nam?

Maybe he should be worried. About me.

The heroin. You don't have it.

...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.

I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?

I thought you said the eggs weren't...

Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!

Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.

Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!

...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!

Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...

Junior year!

A woman can write a check.

That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!

What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?

Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!

Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?

I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?

That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --

So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?

I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.

Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.

I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.

You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!

If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...

Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.

So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?

What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?

You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?

I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...

Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.

Oh, you mean Fred.

You never gave us a chance...

I just want everything to be perfect between us.

I don't think your friend likes me.

Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...

David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?

Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?

George...

...like the water purifiers?

...well, then you ain't got much.

That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?

What's the matter here?

Where you headed, Betty?

I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.

I left my husband two days ago.

I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.

Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!

I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!

I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.

No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?

Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?

This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?

Are you sure I can borrow this?

Rosa...

You should have a little faith in people.

What are you doing?

Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...

That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.

It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?

All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?

Now, that's really stupid.

You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.

I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?

Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!

We don't know which Buick, do we?

Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.

He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.

I hope you're right...

So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.

Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.

What?

Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!

What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...

It's a very moving experience, trust me.

Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?

I'm not telling.

So you believed the bartender. Why?

What doesn't?

'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...

What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!

What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?

If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.

...and how long did she work here?

Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?

Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.

She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.

All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!

...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?

Because it ain't natural, young man.

No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?

So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?

Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?

You lie, motherfucker...

Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?

I see.  Did Chloe testify?

I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.

Waitaminute -

You can't do this -

...but try getting a decent hair jelly.

But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!

Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-

Five... hunnert... thousand... each.

Whuhh...

...I'm not sure that's Pete.

You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!

So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?

I'm sayin' we har this man away.

What's his name again?

Gonna pluck us off the tit.

Suckin' away.

Ass right.

Helluva idea.

No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.

No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?

I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!

Well, I'm sorry honey -

I counted to three, honey.

An' all my meals for free...

But...

That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!

Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.

Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!

...Yeah?

I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!

That's a maiden name.

Come back here, kid!

She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...

Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.

I want your D.O.R.

Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?

Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.

I want to fly, sir!

I don't want to do something anybody can do.

That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!

I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?

Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.

See you in the fleet, sir!

Before that.

No, sir!

What did you call me, Mayo?

I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?

Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...

I don't know what it is. It could be anything.

Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?

Is your brother a flyer?

Vietnam?

You're sure it's okay?

Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...

Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.

How did it go with you guys?

He ask you out for next weekend?

You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?

Lynette, where's Sid?

My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.

Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.

You got a girl?

I think we're making some of the locals jealous.

You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.

You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.

The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.

Hi.

Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.

Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.

I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!

You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.

She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.

You should've done what I did. A clean break.

Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?

You're welcome.

What the fuck is funny about this?

So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!

He said open it.

You got an idea?

Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?

She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!

Get the fuck away from me.

YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!

Fuck!

Who is this guy?

Asshole.

Where did you get this clown?

What tables?  I've never seen him before.

When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.

She said she did.

Be quiet.

Cell phone.

She's never coming out.

I mean it!

I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.

Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.

Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.

We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.

That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?

-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --

Something's weird.

Makes me nervous.

No, Edgar Allen.

Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?

Fuck him.

What if they get in here?

We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 

Fuck.

Morse code?

Call Dad!

He'll do something.

Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?

Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.

I'm sorry, Mom.

Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.

Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...

You're Judge right? We need to talk.

So... we understand each other Judge?

I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.

I can't... they don't operate that way...

God damn... Kid never had a chance...

Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.

I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.

Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...

C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.

Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.

PE? What? You guys doing gym class?

Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?

Now hold on Rodgers...

Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?

You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?

Huey man I got to talk with you...

We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.

You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?

Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?

Whatever you need, I'll be there.

Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?

What's the pig's name?

And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?

Yeah, I do.

Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...

You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...

Sorry man...

Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?

You alright?

Motherfuckers...

You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?

Rose, what the hell you doing here?

This cool the heat off you any?

It's okay Mom. I'm allright.

Yeah.

You meet those friends of yours in jail too?

I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.

I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.

Next time we'll bring more blankets.

You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?

Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?

I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.

Am I one of that sort?

Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.

You don't know him very well, do you?

They're from good stock on their mother's side.

And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.

Goodbye, Charlotte.

Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.

Thank you.

Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.

Their names, ranks and posts?

If I fail, you fail.

And if I triumph, you triumph.

How can we end this madness?

The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...

Is that why the Assembly was convened?

And, Corporal...  ... be careful.

Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.

Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.

Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?

That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.

That's not enough.  Tell me.

We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.

He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.

There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...

One of yours?

I'll see to it that he serves under me.

Fall, six months at the earliest.

Don't touch him.

Don't worry.

Reverend.

Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...

Father, I saw a post rider at the house.

Father... I killed those men...

Honey, Church will be fine.

I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!

Paxcow says it's almost too late!

Please hurry.

Because you promised.

Ellie? What's wrong?

Do you swear?

No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.

You need a glass?

God, that's fine.

What were you listening to?

Nice.

Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?

Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.

What say, Louis?

The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.

You want to rest a bit before you start?

But--

Why, then, things should be fine.

Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--

And Buckaroo Banzai.

That's enough of that kind of talk!

Well, honey...you know that...

Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.

You've got one shot -- and we can't die.

Enough of that!  Name your terms.

The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?

It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.

No, I really think I do.

Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?

There's ... another exit?

That's proper, sir, according to the code.

There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?

Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.

Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.

I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.

It doesn't!

But ... you did it before!  Last time --

You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.

When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!

To freedom.

You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.

These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.

A fool's errand.

Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.

It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.

Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.

Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.

What's your name?

We had time to get to know each other.

Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?

I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.

You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'

Tortuga?

Shut up, before you lose them all!

Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?

You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?

He may be.

That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.

Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.

Has my daughter given you an answer yet?

Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.

Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?

Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.

You can't mean that.

Something to drink, Dr. Bright?

This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.

The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.

I should kill you right now for what you did to me!

How apropos.

It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.

Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?

A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.

Do you think she will give us the designs?

Do you think she loves him?

Icarus?

Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.

Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --

Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.

It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.

Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?

Yeah?  So what?

This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.

Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.

Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?

Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.

What are you going to do?

Of course, sir.

There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?

Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?

You're afraid of him.

What's it smell like?

Sir, please try to hold still.

I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.

And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.

We'll see?  What does that mean?

Daniel, give him the Trix.

You don't know?

Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!

Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!

We don't have time for hysterics.

Why do we need it?

That was an egg?

And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!

How far can you stretch?

No cheese.

I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.

You saved my life.

God, what a fight that was.

What?  I'm not going anywhere!

Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?

Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --

Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.

Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.

I think I better go, Stew.

May I use your telephone?

I suppose you're going to print them?

Will - uh - five thousand be enough?

I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.

Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?

I know that.

Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!

I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.

Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I

This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.

You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane  goes out and counts the silverware.

Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.

It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!

You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.

a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.

This way.

I knew your managing editor very well.

Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about

So, you see how silly that rumor is?

Thank you very much.

Give my regards to your managing editor.

Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?

How's that?

Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.

Right - for the first time this year.

What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?

Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -

Just a boid in a gilded cage -

The one about the Siberian bloodhound?

Araby?

Who are you?

Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?

Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.

Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?

Yes.

Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?

That's a lovely dress.

You what?

Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?

Thanks, thanks.

Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.

Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?

My error.

Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.

Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -

Sure - I think so, Stew.

My mistake - she's glaring.

They all consider me just as one of the boys.

You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.

Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.

Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?

Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.

Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?

Who was that?

What did he want?

What other girl?

Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?

A statement? Good.

The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.

I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.

Thanks. May I sit down?

I don't eat waffles.

I'm sorry nobody could come.

Double-strength!

Smythe, you've been drinking.

Nobody seems to want to do anything  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?

Heavens! The man's insane!

Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.

Did you call, sir?

Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?

Yes sir.

Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.

Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.

Have you got any make up?

And they won't be able to tell?

Wait.

I'm so proud of you, Bud.

Where'd you get this?

Wait ...

Like a drum.

What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?

Oh yeah.

... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.

It's s'posed to happen, Biff.

What'll it be?

Want some bridge mix?

Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...

Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.

Are you alright?  What is it?

I thought I was allowed to defend myself.

YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!

BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!

What's outside of Pleasantville?

What are you doing?

Lemme see that.

Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.

God, David. Just give it to me!

Oh my God.

Noooooo!

No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!

Can we do any better?

I could like kill a guy with these things.

What do you mean?

You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.

Me too. Sounds swell.

You're reading?

D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?

Keeps going ...

Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.

Mmmmgh.

Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.

So what's it like?

Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.

Can I open it?

Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?

You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?

Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.

... Her father.

How much does it cost?

Why would I do that?

Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.

Excuse me?

Look ...

Where's the remote control I gave you?

EXCUSE ME?

Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?

Because you're coming home.

So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...

Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.

There's worse places.

Do you have the lettuce?

Have you cooked the burgers?

Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.

... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...

Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...

It's beautiful.

You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.

Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.

Saw you at the mall yesterday.

So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?

I'm just working....I have some customers here.....

Well, I can't talk though --

I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?

It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...

Yes, indeed, yes I am.

Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.

Well I don't want to do something like that.

You look nervous.

Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?

-- do you think you'll ask her out?

I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?

Yeah I can't.

What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --

I'm going to work.

I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.

I know but I....how much is it?

Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.

Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?

Why did you tell me you did, then?

Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.

Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?

It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?

I saw a picture of you.

I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.

Who is it?

...really? That's nice...are you lying?

You like her?

So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....

-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?

No I didn't say that.

My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --

What did he want?

Ok....well...I'm gonna go.

I don't know.

I don't freak out very often.

HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?

Where you married?

Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.

I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....

I forgot about that.

Yes I'm sorry.

Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?

I'm sorry.

....I'm not exactly sure what that means...

Did you have my home phone number?

I didn't do that.

Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?

What do you mean?

Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.

It's ok, take your time.

You want her to call you Jack?

Who is this?

Now are you threatening me, dick?

Yeah.

I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?

I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?

...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?

You ok?

Why you wearin' a suit?

What's up?

I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.

You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.

It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.

Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...

I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.

I know.

I know.

Hello?

He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --

Yeah.

Are you ready?

You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.

I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?

"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"

I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.

If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --

Marquis? Is that you?

"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."

"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"

I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --

In part, yes.

Don't come back, not tonight, not again --

If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --

They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.

Free his mouth.

Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?

But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --

It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.

It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?

Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.

My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?

That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --

If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.

What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!

Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --

Of course.

Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --

It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.

Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.

Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?

It was fiction, of course.

I'll do everything in my power --

You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.

This child let loose the beast from its cage --

How is the patient faring?

"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"

But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.

My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!

You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...

A kiss for each page.

The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...

Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!

Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --

I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.

I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.

But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?

-- words alone are insufficient.

Good God, Marquise --

So you ever gonna do a picture?

It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.

You're just scared.

It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?

When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.

Oh, why is that?

How bad is it?

The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.

It's not really--

You gotta wake up now. Pops.

castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--

The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...

love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "

That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.

And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.

What are movies about?

That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.

Sorry to disappoint.

Fuck you--

I don't have it anymore?!

Why her?

The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.

I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--

And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '

This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.

Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--

Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.

Is that from one of the Gospels?

Shit

He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.

They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.

To do what?

You're going to destroy it

Yes

"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.

A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--

Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.

And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?

What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about

You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture

Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!

You're not still mad at me, I hope

I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?

It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.

Orson, you wanna take five?

How 'bout a real drink?

Oh, no--

We're from...

I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.

Hey champ!

What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?

What who's been sayin'?

I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.

C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.

Jack, I got no gloves.

What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?

Who's that?

Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.

Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?

Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.

They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.

Whatcha doin'?

Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.

Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.

Except fall down like a normal person.

Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?

I did keep an eye...

Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.

I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.

Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.

Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!

He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.

You don't talk very much.

I can't find my ball.

You said never to touch you before a fight.

Now take the rest off.

Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...

I was just...

Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?

You sure you're not thinking of him right now?

You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.

What's the matter with you?

I went out.

What'd you see?

What'd you see?

Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?

Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy?  Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt!  Who've you been fuckin'?

You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.

You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?

Why don't you just call him up?

I dunno.

Vickie, open up. I need to come in.

The kids are sleeping.

Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!

How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?

Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?

What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.

Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.

I said, let's go.

Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?

No, you're his wife.

I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.

And you're drinking with them right now.

I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.

It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.

I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.

It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.

You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.

Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.

He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.

She never left the apartment --

-- until yesterday morning.

Who said they left then?

I can't do it even if he's gone.

Did you ever own a saw?

Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.

For what?

Wrong day?

Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?

Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.

Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.

Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?

Something wrong?

Hello.

Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.

I can't. The police have it by now.

How can you tell that from a thermometer!

Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?

You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.

Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?

You're never going to marry?

The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.

Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.

The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.

He and his wife splitting up?

A Federal offense.

Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.

Huh?

Mrs. Thorwald?

You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?

There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?

What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?

Ten here.

It is something really important, Jeff?

I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.

Who's Thorwald?

It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.

Big enough?

Don't laugh. -- I could do it!

I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.

Lisa, simmer down -- will you?

Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --

Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.

Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?

Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.

He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.

But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.

They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.

I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.

Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.

Nobody chickened.

What's happening?

You know something?

Machismo?

Buzz Gundersen.

That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.

Tell him why we moved here.

Mother--

Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?

Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?

What would you do, Dad?

Well, just get it off your chest, son.

Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.

You sure?

I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.

Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.

I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!

Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--

I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!

See?  It stopped.

They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.

Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?

Where did you get the gun?

You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?

I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.

You shouldn't monkey with him.

I'm here.

It's me!

Isn't he schizoid?

That's swell.  How are you?

You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?

Sit down and eat--you'll be late.

Do I have to spell it out?

Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.

No.

Things pretty tough for you at home?

If he could--

I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.

Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.

See?

Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?

Goodbye!  See you!

They'll be looking for you.

You cold?

You can trust me, Judy.

Ever been in a place like this before?

Maybe he's scared of the dark.

Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--

Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.

Is he your friend?

Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?

Hi, Plato!

He makes you feel pretty unhappy?

Do you think your father means that?

Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?

Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--

But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!

I was talking to Dad.

You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.

IS THIS NICK MASON!!??

Gabriel, you promised!

Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...

He wants... your "sister"...

Searching for a money man...

I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.

Toys for... adults?

Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.

Saw me --

All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.

Where the hell are you going?

Well, I don't know about that --

We'll have more fun in Detroit.

I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.

I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.

You sold him out.

I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!

Get the hell off of me!

No, Nick, no --

He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --

Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --

You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.

I love you, Nick...

You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.

He wants to see your map.

Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.

Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?

I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.

You... you... YOU --

I saved your life.

Merry Christmas, Rudy.

No, you can't --

You're not Nick Mason...

What'd they call her in college?

You knew the place --

So what the hell good are you...

Got something to say to me, Nick?

You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?

Start singing.

No gun.

That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.

Get in the CAR!

Ash?

How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?

There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?

Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.

The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.

This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.

I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?

Thanks, sister. How are ya.

You want that for here or to go?

THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!

What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?

Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.

Don't look like he missed the sunlight.

Tell her... I'll be there ...

Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --

That was my king!

Map is kinda dirty, Monster...

That I should've picked you up?

Seymour Scagnetti.

Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.

Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.

We can work this out, can't we?

What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?

I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?

Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.

Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.

The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."

Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?

The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.

Me and Mr. White?

Let's go over it. Where are you?

Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...

Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.

Wong?

Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.

Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.

Give me this fucking thing.

I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.

When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.

I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.

What's she doin' now?

Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.

Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.

What's the cut, poppa?

He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.

Larry, I'm gonna kill him.

Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?

That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!

What're you talkin' about?

I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.

Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.

Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.

Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.

Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.

Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?

Dead.

As opposed to good?

As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.

No real people?

Nope.

I got the diamonds.

No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.

Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.

Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.

Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.

So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.

Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.

We're going to look for him. Want to come along?

And that's more important than finding Lednov?

Who shot who?

You don't know how good it is to see you.

They won't be riding in the wagon.

And this is Helen Carter.

Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.

If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?

Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.

Like what?

Get back to the horses. They're straggling.

Coffee?

You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?

I hope you get everything you want out of life --

I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.

You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.

Tell me, darling.

I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.

Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.

Thanks for taking over.

Where you going?

Drop yours. I'm gunshy.

That's right.

Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.

You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?

They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.

They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.

Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.

Oh... that's the time you went away.

Yeah, it does.

Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?

I didn't stop to think, Clay.

How's that?

I can't take her with me.

Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.

Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?

I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.

Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.

There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.

Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.

You think that's all we busted -- You should see...

It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.

Give it back to him. We're leavin'.

I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.

How do you know who we are?

I said let's go.

That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.

Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?

Would you like to learn them?

Maybe I could start you out.

Gee, I can't.

What do they look like?

For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.

You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.

Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.

Me, too. 101?

Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.

Really? That's amazing.

Help!

Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.

Cindy, what's going on?

This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.

No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.

No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.

Hello Brenda.

I meant you're into ghosts.

But, hey, maybe we can be friends.

Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.

Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.

I know, but I've been thinking --

Look, what I'm trying to say --

Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.

You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...

Hey, look out, a bee!

Oh, right.

How about these buns?

Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?

Stop touching his brain!

What are we gonna do?

Father!

I'm sorry.

Huh?

Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...

Am I cool now?

Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?

Alright, Cindy, what's so important?

I'm telling you, it was possessed.

No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.

I finished all the interviews.

Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.

The image there.

That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.

Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?

What if I wanted to borrow those keys?

She's right. We should stick together.

Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.

It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.

You're not wearing a belt.

Uh... I'm Father McFeely

She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.

Yes.

Oh shit, you gonna take that?

Father, I think you should rest.

Sit down and join us, Cindy.

Now you're being rude, Shorty.

Yo' Tommy, what up, man?

BLOOD FEAST!

Did you hear?

0h, shit!

Hi!

 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.

Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!

Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!

Sorry, ma'am.

Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!

You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!

You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.

Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.

I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.

Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.

In here, Mom...

Get in, Mom! I have to open.

Are you Chip Sutphin?

TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!

What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.

He goes to college with me!

She's gonna kill Scotty!

I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.

It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?

Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!

Beverly! Not the Sterners!

Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?

You bitch!

Who is this?

Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...

So you do drink?

Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!

You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 

Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.

It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?

Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!

That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?

Are we leaving?

SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!

What was that?

I'll give you fifty cents.

You know who I am, August?

You can't tell.

Let's get out of here.

We can't stand here all night.

Then, you also understand that you must die.

Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?

I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.

I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.

It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.

I haven't got that much in cash.

Why, Mary --

Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	"The Dante."

I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.

What did she want?

Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact - I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her  to see her  to touch her  in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.

Yes, of course  but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.

I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.

It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.

The people at the restaurant?

Could you find him?

I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.

At least you knew about Dr. Judd.

I have been at the library.

I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.

I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.

It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --

It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --

I had begun to write again -that's whet I was doing when you came in.

And you believe that?

If it is true  there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.

I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.

Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.

I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?

What was she to you?

Following me to find Jacqueline?

Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.

I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?

A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?

It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.

Would they hurt her?

I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.

I was a great dancer...

Is it about Jacqueline?

But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.

This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it  your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?

I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.

Yes  yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.

We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.

No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.

Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.

Because I have something very important to do.

It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.

I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.

Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.

You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.

Ann?

Oh, uh-huh.

No, I think you look... fine.

Well...

Oh, I like it. I like it very much.

You mean like "time flies"?

That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.

Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?

You're what?

Does it bother you?

I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.

Like what?

And they just answer them?

You know?

Do you think that's such a good idea?

I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.

Tell me your name.

Yes.

You don't know what I'm thinking.

Did you have sex before you were married?

Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!

About me?

On tape?

That's correct.

Her name was Elizabeth.

No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.

If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?

If you were in love with me, would you?

So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?

Who? Elizabeth?

Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?

Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?

Why are you ashamed?

Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.

Something wrong?

Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.

I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.

I'm not either!!

I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.

I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.

What?

Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?

Goddam right.

Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?

Ann, do you see a pattern here?

Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --

Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?

Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.

Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?

No, he left last week.

It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?

You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?

I hate my sister.

Uh-huh. So what's he look like?

Ann, you always underestimate me.

"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?

And what?

Fine.

I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.

No!

No, it's nothing like that.

I don't want to talk about it.

He just asked me questions.

Apparently.

He wouldn't do that.

No, but I did.

Here it is.

Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.

Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.

The extrovert.

I just want to know why you're here.

What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?

You just want to ask me questions?

Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?

How long will it take?

Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --

Your first sexual experience.

What did you think? Did it look like you expected?

What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?

What did he say?

I would.

Who said I was jealous?

Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.

Afraid of getting caught?

I'm intrigued.

John?

Hello.

I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.

It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.

Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?

Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.

If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.

Plus first and last month deposit.

Not for three-fifty.

No.

Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!

IBM.

Mr. Millaney?

Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.

Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.

You're the one who found the bodies?

So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?

Kiss, kiss?

I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.

Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?

You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.

Where is this thing that attacked your wife?

Want me to breathe deeply?

Well, let's wait for the X-rays.

Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.

Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.

Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.

OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.

GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY

BREAKING OUT

You bet, Bert.

Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?

They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.

About Brad's family?

You got it!

Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?

But...how?

SPONSOR!!!

With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.

In a way...

Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.

Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.

I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE

SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY

I'd forgotten.

What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.

I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.

Oh my poor baby.

I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.

Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.

BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?

I NEED SOME

Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.

Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?

You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.

He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.

Brad!

F for...

Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.

Our field.

No, we're from San Diego. Why?

You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.

Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.

The problem with that is that then there's one extra --

Why are you being so defensive?

Bye.

Are you there? Miles?

I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.

Hey, Miles. Long time no see.

When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.

Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?

Glass or bottle?

You okay, Miles?

You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?

You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.

How you doin' tonight, beautiful?

I can explain.

Anything I'd know?

No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...

Don't open that now. It's warm.

Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?

Did you read the latest draft, by the way?

Whoa, why are we getting off?

What?

This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.

Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.

Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.

Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?

Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.

You know, you could work in a wine store.

Yeah. Tight.

Oh, yeah. That's Maya.

Sure I know Maya.

Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?

The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.

Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.

I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.

She what?  When?

What do you think?

We're on.

So what should I wear?

Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.

Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.

Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.

You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --

Right now.

What'd Christine say?

Does she know about Saturday?

I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.

Look who's talking. You've been there.

With Maya.

Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?

Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...

We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.

That's thoughtful.

So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.

What's it look like to you?

Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.

We gotta go back.

Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...

Fuck you. I'll get it myself.

What the fuck!

Uh-uh. You're on your own.

Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.

I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?

So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.

What are you drinking?

Hi.

Yeah, weird. But great.

So what's your novel about?

So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?

Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.

Well...

I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?

I don't know. Why are you into wine?

I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.

I had class.

You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.

No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.

Were you ever going to say anything?

He's an actor, so it can't be good.

Oh, Maya. No.

Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.

That was big of him.

Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.

Should we get dessert?

Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!

Where's Jack?

So what are you up to today, Miles?

Huh.

Oops. Sorry.

Hi, guys. We should probably get going.

It was a surprise, Mom.

You talked to Wendy?

It makes me feel better.

No.

There's dust in it.

Daddy.

The same windows.

I see.

It was very dark.

This guy got on the roof in like a second.

How can you say that?

That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.

They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.

Where are you going?

I'm sorry, what book is this?

They're on the roof.

This is going to do nothing.

How many died?

Don't touch him.

Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?

These are D's; I need double A's.

Morgan?

I can't even imagine.

You said something was strange. What's strange?

What about them?

Is anything missing?

It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.

There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.

See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.

Is that him?

If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.

All I did was kiss a girl.

So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.

Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.

Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?

I think we lost 'em.

Forget it.

Maybe we'll see you sometime.

...Gotta go...

I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.

This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.

I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.

Kate?

Gotta go.

I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.

Hobart, what are you people doing here?

Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.

Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.

I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.

South of here, past Chimayo.

I gotta be going.

What's Turley like?

Doesn't look quite fair.

Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.

All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.

Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.

Where is Rae?

Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.

That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.

Where's your brother?

Get out of here, Jake.

Hello, Rae.

He was murdered.

I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.

Get out. We have nothing to talk about.

What's stopping you?

Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.

I see you're prospering without me.

I took out thirteen dollars.

I told you this was a sweet set-up.

I thought we talked about that.

My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.

That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.

I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.

What makes you say that?

Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.

From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.

Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?

Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.

We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.

I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.

Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.

Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.

God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?

-- What's wrong with that?

It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.

You're not renewing my contract.

I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?

Why isn't she with you?

I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".

Why not?

Sorry I didn't get her back in time.

Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.

Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.

There isn't one.

Even the fall from the plane?

Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.

I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?

Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.

I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.

Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?

I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?

That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.

Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?

Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?

Thank Simone for the tickets.

-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.

You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.

What I do to Simone?

That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.

Absolutely not!

You can't.

Is she here?

I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.

It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"

You have to see her.

-- We call them "vactors".

An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.

"Straw God" changed my life.

There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?

I'm sorry Mom canned you.

You know, I... don't know.

Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?

You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.

Good-night, Daddy.

I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.

The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.

You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.

Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.

I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.

What is it exactly you want, Sayer?

That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.

Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.

-- Nicola!  How was your massage?

It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.

Thank you.  It's not important.

Would you like me to read?

You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.

You could play the lead.

A star is...

You did create me.

See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.

The only real truth is in the work.

You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.

Are you calling me?

I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.

What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.

No.

Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.

I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.

Know what?

I didn't know you were funny.

No.

Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.

You weren't a paper champion.

Are you wigging out?

You have nice red in your cheeks now.

She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?

I wish I were somewhere else.

I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?

You were great in the play, Cole.

I'd give anything to have been there.

Communicate?

A lady. She died.

Cole, you're scaring me.

Dead people?

You see ghosts, Cole?

I don't know how else to look--

How did you--?

Stuttering--

I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.

Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.

Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?

Witch.

Bitch.

Rod... I have to get back to my job.

I happen to be a professional.

There's something weird going on here, Suzie.

Gene.

You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?

Sounds familiar.

Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!

Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.

"Peggy-Sue" --

Are you crazy?

Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.

What are you going to do? Shoot me?

Joseph Macdonald... Your son.

How... was she "called?"

Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.

You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.

-- And keep your eyes on the road.

Hey -- Macdonald's farm!

Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.

You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.

Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!

Yes!

You never told us you grew up on a farm.

So?

No --

...no... Mac... p-please...

Where's Mac?

Bill, you're Chief of police now. 

Shit.

Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!

Sorry.

Pretty, ain't they?

Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?

Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.

That wasn't a good night, no.

We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?

He's a fucking Martian?!

Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.

You're lookin' awful pretty.

Sure thing, killer.

He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.

But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.

Where'd he go?

What's he get if he wins here?

You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.

Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.

Kate McConnell.

Seriously?!?

Well?

Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.

Christ, what channel are we on?...

Hey...

Jesus!!!

What the hell are you doing?!?

-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?

I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.

-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.

I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?

Or in the slammer.

You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.

Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.

Bandit?

Liquid gold.

Let's get the hell outta here.

Bandit?

I hate to say it...

-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...

Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.

We're outta motion lotion.

-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.

Bandit II?

You're coming up to the scale house.

How's the clock, Bandit II.

I think you're just yellow.

Bandit two, you read me?

But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?

That crazy sumbitch made it.

-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.

Anything on the Swede?

What about the sheriff's task force?

Maroon uniforms?

Two of 'em?

If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.

Are you on a land line?

I've got concerns.

There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.

No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --

I'm here, where's the car?

I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.

D'you talk to'm?

Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!

I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.

I could have it sent out...

Do you want me to say I'm sorry?

I am. Yeah.

Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!

FUCK YOU!

-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --

Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.

So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?

It's the last place they'd look.

What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!

I can't discuss --

...Yeah, fifty-three.

...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?

You got clicks, anything?

Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.

... Jesus... what for?

Wow.

Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.

Right, you got clicks, anything?

Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?

Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.

Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?

Are you anywhere near the penthouse?

I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...

You'll end up like me.

No?  Who am I, then?

Where's his body?

Listen --

You killed her!

In his lab.  He won't let you in.

Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.

How long can you go without sleep?

Was her breakfast conversation that bad?

What will you say?

Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.

You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --

Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.

Perhaps it did.

What plan?

Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...

You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?

What's wrong with you?  We need your help.

I need to see Snow.

Then it's God, right?

You still don't believe in God?

I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.

What does Snow think you should do?

He has a point.

How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?

Chris --

Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.

I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.

I think they help.

They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.

Followed by non-human manifestations.

Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.

It's terrific Win.

Are you nervous?

Would you pick one out, please?

You can touch me, I won't bite.

I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.

Claire?

Didn't do very well, did you?

Yeah.  It was.

What about Neil?

What a memory.

How long you going away for?

So.

Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.

... just saying you should think twice about it...

Keep what handy?

Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.

Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?

What shit, honey?

Honey.  You got him.

I'd identify him.

Bought it.

Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?

I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.

I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.

I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.

But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!

Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!

Wasn't your fault.

Tell me I'm dreamin'.

Why should she come in?

Under the table.

How do you know where the gun is?

God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!

She's what?

Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.

What's in there?

Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.

I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--

Uh is a good start.

I hate the Platonic idea of you.

-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.

I suppose.

Some prep school thing.

Well, no.

You sure about all this?

Yeah, Roz.

I am old enough to--

I'm a photographer, remember?

Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.

A match made in heaven.

Oh, Ben gets through everything.

How much do you know about it?

You never know.  Go get some sleep.

Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?

Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?

Why? It is a wrestling match, or

Where'd you get the clown suit?

So they're airing this tonight?

I sent for  the police.  We can explain.

Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?

I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...

Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!

Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.

What's the match gag?

I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!

They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.

There's only one pair left.

I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?

Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.

What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?

Brother, were we all wet about you!

Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.

Then we're all in on it?

Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.

You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.

You won't get off that cheap.

I am Lieutenant Dunbar.

I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.

Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.

What is this? This is water?

No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!

Easy, Animal! Easy!

You did?

That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.

Grable, not Gable!

But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!

I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.

Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.

Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --

You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.

Not yet.

Why the south latrine?

Los, los. Dummkopf!

Stay out of it, Sefton.

You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.

What are we going to do with him?

You taking Dunbar?

Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!

Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.

Shapiro. Shapiro.

Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?

I'll kill you for that!

Six o'clock. I was having dinner.

The what?

Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.

We have no radio.

Wie hat er's gemacht?

Good morning, Sefton.

Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?

I do not want those cigarettes.

What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?

It's working.

Where is he now?

Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.

Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.

This is its current position.

Are any of them inhabited?

Population?

Is she still angry?

I get it. I get it.

Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.

Deck 15, section 21-alpha.

Where is he now?

These are my children...my children.

Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.

So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?

How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?

I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?

Yes.  Thank you.

Oh

Kirk here.

I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?

Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?

Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.

Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.

Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.

There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.

It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.

Doctor Soran?

They have found a way to penetrate our shields.

It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.

Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...

Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!

What's going on? When do we get paid off...?

Mr. Chekov -- ?

Will we get another ship?

Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.

Response?

Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.

Still no response, sir.

Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?

All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.

Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...

My readings indicate great instability.

What is it?

You mean, we're stranded down here?!

How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!

The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...

I don't understand.

Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?

Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.

Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.

Captain, what's happening?!

Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.

Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --

Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.

What's wrong?

How many more?

Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.

... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?

Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.

Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!

Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?

Would you look at that?

May I ask why...?

David?... David!

Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.

Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...

... He spoke of your friendship.

My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.

Sir, may I --

You amaze me, Commander.

You're not going in there -- !

Physician, heal thyself.

Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?

Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?

Say thank you.

Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?

Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?

... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --

Are you sure these are the coordinates?

A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --

He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?

Where's Dr. Marcus --

It's the Genesis Wave!

Let go -- he can't -- !

What are <u>you</u> looking at?

At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?

Well?

Departing dark side, Regula.

Thirty seconds...

Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...

An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?

We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?

Uhura. Can't you augment?

Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.

... No response, sir.

Midshipman, you're a tiger.

The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.

Yes, Spock.

And who is this?

Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?

I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.

Is the word given?

There's a first time for everything, Admiral.

That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.

But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...

You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.

Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.

It literally is Genesis...

Gentlemen, this isn't --

Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.

Affirmative, Admiral.

All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.

That's it?

I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?

Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...

Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.

Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?

I failed to resolve the situation.

Reliant's command...

That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.

It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.

What's on your mind, Lieutenant?

Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?

Hold your course. Look sharp...

I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.

Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.

Admiral on the bridge --

Phaser lock inoperative, sir.

Prepare for warp speed.

We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.

He's not what I expected, Sir.

Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?

I do not understand the final question...

I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.

I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!

Oh, joy.

An experimental device, doctor.

Hi... Busy?

Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?

Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...

Specifically, Humpback Whales.

You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.

You're saying... It is a compliment.

Fundoscopic examination --

What's causing that!?

Can you isolate the wave?

... It gives me a great sense of history.

Shields, Mr. Chekov.

Status report, Admiral!

You sure you won't change your mind?

You mean man...

He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.

We don't want to be any trouble.

Then --

He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?

You're upset about losing the whales.

You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.

Thanks. Cheers.

My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?

Wanna try it from the top?

Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.

Here... In the park?

It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.

Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?

Where are you going?!

Is there any other planet where this species exists?

Mr. Spock, your computations?

Ready to engage computer, Admiral.

There is a 20th Century possibility.

If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.

As you observed, a primitive Culture.

Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...

Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.

You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.

You've done it before. Can't you remember?

It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.

Status?

That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?

Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.

No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.

Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?

Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...

What is our condition?

Three-one-zero, aye!

10 seconds, sir!

Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?

I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.

We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?

Any luck...?

I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.

Estimate range, ship to whales!

Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...

You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...

Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?

Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?

Hello? Computer...?

Father...?

Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.

Will it?

I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.

There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?

When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...

How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...

You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.

There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.

Don't you ever get tired?

Do machines ever play?

Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?

Anij!

I have to go home now.

Can he breathe under water?

Hello, Data...

I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.

... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.

Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...

I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...

Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.

You're not going to launch anything until...

The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...

I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...

In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.

It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?

A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.

What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...

I don't believe it happened that way.

His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...

Implants bothering you?

Will that stop the tear?

The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...

What's inside that nebula cluster?

I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...

Who is it?

Would you like something to eat?

Worf to Picard...

I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...

He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.

Come out, come out wherever you are...

Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...

Scanners are off line!

You need a haircut, Commander.

Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...

Why would we be involved with these people?

What you're doing to my neck...

It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...

This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...

Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...

Augh.

This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?

The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?

Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?

What are we waiting for? Let's go.

Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...

Do you know what this is, Data?

I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.

No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...

Dispersive armor is holding.

What year is it?

Who are you?

The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.

Data... are you sure you're all right?

"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?

Where?

I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.

Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.

This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.

Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...

Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.

No... the door's too thick.

What's still there?

Entering the upper ionospere...

Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...

Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.

Yes.

That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?

From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.

Did you need something?

No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.

All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?

Why?

Port battery, ready sir!

Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!

Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.

Hull integrity down to thirty percent...

We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...

Captain?

What the hell is happening, Worf?

We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.

Report!

Emergency override!

Report.

They're bypassing Engineering...

I have to admit there was a moment there when --

Worf to Bridge.

They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...

Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.

Good luck, Captain.

Spock, that was actually funny.

Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...

Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.

Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.

Damned clever if you ask me...

This is fun...

My God, what happened here?

What?

You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?

Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.

Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.

Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...

I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.

Isn't it about time you became something else?

What took you so long?

And your coat.

How did you know...?

We don't get many presidential assassins.

Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.

I know how to get outside the shield.

Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...

Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.

I hope you're happy.

Just the prototype.

Standing by, Captain Kirk.

Surely not.

According to my information, today.

WE volunteered?

We HAVEN'T fired -

The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.

Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?

You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.

How did you - ?

Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.

Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?

Direct hit -

Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.

I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --

Praxis?

At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -

A computer canna lie, sir.

That could take hours!

They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...

They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.

I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.

You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?

Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?

He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.

I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.

Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.

Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.

As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.

How long does he have?

To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.

You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.

So... To happy endings.

To new worlds...

He is very observant.

Data!

My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.

A bit less florid, Data.

A weapon.

Yes, sir.

What do you imagine this is?

How long until we reach the fleet?

"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.

Yes.

We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.

Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.

I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.

Yes.

It's you.

Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.

It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.

Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.

That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.

It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.

How long until he can fire?

You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.

Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.

Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.



Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.

We're being hailed.

Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --

We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.

Why don't they answer our hails?

Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.

Strength in numbers?

But she's not the Enterprise.

Serving with you has been an honor.

It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...

I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.

It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.

The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!

Yes.

I don't know.

Its too late.

Target disruptors. Destroy them.

Well, that sounds relaxing too.

Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.

This is a mistake.

The bond is broken.

How long?

How long until we reach the Rift?

But surely...

And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?

The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.

Benny, there's nothing there.

Don't you think you should call a backup?

Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.

What do you do?

Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?

Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.

Where did you stop last?

That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.

Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.

Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...

Clarify that.

You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...

You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.

We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.

Hello George.

This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?

Please.

What?

Steering wheel.

Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...

Which way?

What?

Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?

Shit.

No, no... don't say that. Bad word.

Satisfied? Now get out. Out.

Money.

Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?

Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.

But I must go here.

Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.

Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.

Well... I'm going to go now.

Goodbye.

You thought we were a different planet?!

Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'

Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?

A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...

The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.

Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.

It's bad.

What are you doing?

I like this music.

You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.

The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.

How long will it take you to get home?

There.

The yellow one.

Help me!!!

You sure this is your car?

Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.

You get that, Lyman?

They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.

Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?

There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.

I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.

Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?

Hello...

Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?

You said you were going to get her out of this.

Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.

This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.

Jesus.

Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.

You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.

I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.

You talked to Iris?  When?

Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.

You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.

How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?

So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.

Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.

See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.

You should feel like shit.

But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--

What stuff?

I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.

So there never was a death squad.

Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.

Charm.

Commissioner Strickland.

Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.

What the fuck are you doing?

Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?

That would be no.

I thought we were friends.

Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.

What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.

My God, Lenny.  What is it?

Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.

No it doesn't.

She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.

If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.

Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?

How's Zander?

I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.

Whatup Lenny?

What is it?

Lenny, have you lost it completely?

Those two guys were cops.

I've got a good idea, yeah.

I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.

Who's Strickland?

Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--

I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.

That's the original.  There are no copies.

Are we under arrest?

Hey, Lenny.  We made it.

No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?

Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?

He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.

Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.

Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!

Have you had a chance to think about --

Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?

Where's the Nuevo American Diner?

I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.

Who knows.

Agent Mackelway.

The room key's in the car. On the seat.

You have the body?

Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.

I've been looking for you.

The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?

Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.

We have another one.

Speck. Harold Speck.

I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?

How do you send out an APB on a dead man?

You didn't tell anyone where you were?

I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.

He's got you believing in Zero now too.

Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.

You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.

You are so fucked up.

None taken.

I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.

Yes I do.

I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.

Look at this fellow... or this one.

None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.

I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?

When you were his student? Did he come on to you?

There are Agency regulations about this.

I've been thinking about this.

He's called a couple times.

Find the feet?

You mean --

And nobody else can do that?

Hello?

Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.

I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.

Tom, you okay?

Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.

Who are you?

How's the arm?

Suspect Zero?

And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.

There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.

We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.

I've been to Chicago.

Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.

I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.

Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?

"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.

This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.

Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.

Are you calling Her?

You should call your Grandmother.

You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?

...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.

Anything?

You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?

...not until you book it...

They're out of Glenlivet.

I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".

Let me just check on my boy.

The poor thing. Six years?

Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.

On the table.

You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.

Do you have anything smaller?

Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.

Well... This is it.

I'll have to come see you sometime.

Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?

How are you doing?

Yeah.

It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.

Well that sucks.

Right... Wait, what do you mean?

I didn't mention her once today.

How many strokes?

Oh.  Where is this place?

I'll get a Dewars rocks... 

What's that guy's name? Sue?

You haven't been drinking, have you?

What's dumb about it?

You miss the pain?

Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?

You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.

Who threw this party, anyway?

Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.

Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 

Mike?

You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.

VEGAS.

Wake up, baby.

Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.

They're all skanks.

You're gonna screw up our plan.

Double down.

I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.

What an asshole.

I can't believe what an asshole you are.

You think so?

That's bullshit.

...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...

Nice, baby.

Baby, you did fine.

You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.

What was the part?

"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?

...So give me the fuckin part...

No, man. I need to use the phone.

She was hot.

Yeah, a good friend.

I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.

Who? Rob?

We got the digits, baby.

Bitch... You little bitch!

They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!

Baby, don't talk that way, baby...

You're money.

...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...

It is on.

Sorry man.

The bear's got his claws back.

I'm telling you. Wait three days...

...Okay, two...

...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.

Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.

The Court gave you justice.

But your daughter is still alive.

Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.

You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?

Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?

What's the matter, Carlo?

You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.

He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.

I'll think about it.

Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.

You take care of your family?

You mean Tattaglia.

Have you thought about a wife?  A family?

I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.

I see you have your Luca Brasi.

Beautiful all over, eh?

You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.

Ever seen anything like that before?

Give them some money and send them home.

Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?

Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?

What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?

Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.

The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.

Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.

Mike, why am I out?

Michael, what are those men doing?

Then the thighs where they joined the torso.

I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.

Michael...

I LOVE YOU.

I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.

Tell me!

I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.

Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.

Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?

Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.

Mikey, you look beautiful!

O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?

Do you renounce Satan.

And all his works?

Do you wish to be baptized?

The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!

Is he alive?

I just woke up. I'm sorry.

Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.

Uncanny!

Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.

I hope it wasn't cheap.

He's drowning me!

It's just an undercoat. 

You know, a primer.

I'm never going back!

That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.

The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.

I know. I write like a child.

It's just there's so much to do in a single day.

Get undressed in your own room, would you?

Freddie drove me back in his car.

What are you talking about?

What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?

I've got plans!

Then I'll take it as a compliment.

I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.

No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.

This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.

Marge-maintenance.

Who is it?

Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.

What about Christmas?

Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.

Mr Greenleaf.

I'm well, thank you.

I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.

You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --

I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.

I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?

Okay.

I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?

You really should go in, it's marvelous.

How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?

He hates being confronted.

Dickie was at the Opera last night.

I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?

What?

You've got Dickie's rings.

I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.

I told you. He gave them to me.

It's all true.

How would you know that?

No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.

The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.

Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.

Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --

The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.

What?

Ditto.

Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.

What rumour?

Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.

Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.

He's already angry, I don't think --

Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.

Do you want me to stick around?

Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.

Why lie?

What do you mean lied about who you are?

It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?

I really don't want to see anybody.

Was it? Did you speak to Tom?

Thank you.

Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.

Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?

Why?

We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.

Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.

That would have been quite a coincidence.

Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.

I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.

The singer?

Travis, you haven't even played the record?

What are you doing?

Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.

Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.

No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.

No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.

Yeah.

Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."

Fuckin' One-Ball.

Huh?

Yeah. From the likes of them.

What's your name?

What's your real name?

No.

I don't remember.

Where?

God, you are square.

What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...

Why don't you come to a commune with me?

What's so important?

How?

Sure you don't want to come with me?

Why should it be grounded?

No.

Got your license?

Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.

Some. Here and there.

Anything you say, officer.

Well, I just, you know...

Yeah.

Like do anything, you know.

What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.

Stick with Carla.

No.

It's me sir.

He says he's leaving the island sir.

I'll go.

What are you doing?

You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....

Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?

You've got everything?

I see you got the telegram.

Dad?

Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?

Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.

Me too.

So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?

Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?

No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.

Do you have the...

... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.

Sir, that is true.

Yes it does.

All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?

Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.

The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?

Yes.  A prepared statement.

Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...

Here we are.

Yes.

C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.

Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.

Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.

And... what's my name again?

They couldn't wait to see you.

"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"

Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.

Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."

Well...

Zackly.

Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.

Nope.  Can't.  We're through.

'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.

What's wrong?

You kids off to the dance?

It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.

Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?

You should watch what you say.

They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.

Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.

The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.

Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.

Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?

Sit.  Play with me.

T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.

I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.

That you got let go.

They all know you?

That's the one. Cathy Brenner.

I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.

Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?

I was wondering...

Miss Daniels? Is that you?

Thank you.

Or would you rather I changed the subject?

How do you like our little hamlet?

Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.

Then why did she object to you?

I'm sorry. Forgive me.

I did.

Do you think I should go?

Yes.

They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.

Don't you like us?

Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!

What?

Good morning.

I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.

And the white house?

It's a surprise, you see.

Where would I get a boat?

Daniels.

Thank you.

Gulls!

Are you finished here, Sebastian?

One apple pie! You want more coffee?

I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?

She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?

It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...

Yes?

When?

Where will we go?

They're gone. The same pattern.

Where's Mitch?

I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?

Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.

No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.

Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?

Does this room look silly?

He's not home.

Well... yes, sir, there are.

I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.

What are you? A policeman?

What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...

That was the damndest thing I ever saw.

What kind of law?

Ouch!

To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.

Annie. Annie Hayworth.

We... we went to school together. College.

What did it say?

Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.

You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?

The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...

Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?

But you tore it up.

Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!

I'd still like to see you.

Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.

I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?

The town looks clear.

I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.

That... that... who was that?

No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.

They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.

I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...

Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait.

The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.

I don't know why.

Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?

Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...

How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?

I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.

Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?

I'm leaving! Are you coming?

I'm only a student.

-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.

Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.

It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?

You must leave this house.

He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.

I'm cold as ice.

Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --

Dr. MacFarlane --

I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.

I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --

Yes, I suppose so.

Well --

Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --

I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.

Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --

I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.

Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.

You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.

Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?

Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.

You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --

Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --

What did you hear?

You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?

I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?

"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"

But where did they get those people?

Was the paralysis immediate?

Any attacks of pain since?

Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?

I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.

Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?

Check and mate.

Two down. Two to go.

You think I'm crazy.

You killed her. I saw it.

What did they give you?

The scar. Which of you has it?

How do you know?

I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.

I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.

... it connects you to me...

In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.

Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.

Fucking crow.

Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.

Just don't believe everything you see.

Anything wrong?

Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.

What were you yelling about?

What? What is it?

Sweetheart...

You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!

Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?

I would like to explain something of my mission here.

I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.

What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?

One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?

Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?

I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?

Tell me what?

Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?

Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?

Did all these people die in wars?

Bet they're worth about a million dollars.

Bobby -- have you a flashlight?

What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?

Oh, I'd say forty-five.

I don't believe it.

Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.

The present situation?

Perhaps if you could explain a little--

He's not there.  But look what I found in his room

I wonder if we ought to--

I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.

Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?

How do you know?

Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.

Oh -- hello--

What is it you want?

You hold great hope for this meeting.

Where are you going now?

No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.

I was.

Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.

Just passing through Santa Carla?

I don't like horror comics.

They wouldn't be out in the daytime.

All together?

Shut up!

Whattaya mean?

So how do you like those maggots, Michael?

I'm my own man.

Where is she?!

What is this, David?

With him?

C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.

Or a vampire.

I thought they'd be in coffins.

We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.

I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.

Don't go out there!  Stop him!

Ouch, my hair...

Max?  You men we're having company again?

Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.

I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.

It's early.  Why do we have to go home?

I'll hitch.

Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.

Sam.  Is everything all right?

Where's Michael?

Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.

Nanook, stop breathin' on me.

Not funny, Sam!

But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?

Max!  What's wrong?

I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.

Something the matter?

But you passed the test!

Are you following me?

When?

I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?

That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!

Huh?

It's gone.  I feel it!

This is kind of a cool place.

Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!

Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?

Do I have to do this?

Go away.

What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.

Mom's home?...

Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.

What??

It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?

Michael!  Get behind the wheel.

Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?

That night?

Couldn't make much of it myself.

Sure.  You think there's a connection?

You can't let anybody leave!

Let's open it.

Let's open it.  Now...

He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.

I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...

I said where?  Where'd you go?!

Childs!  That a fuse?

... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.

MacReady!

What are you doing?

Load of bullshit.

Not the only one.

Maybe we shouldn't.

Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!

... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.

I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.

After all this mess then.

'Bout eighty kilos southwest.

We're on fire!

Four!

Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...

Maybe it ain't coming.

What do you do on the towers?

How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?

I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.

Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?

My God... I saw this.

Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?

What's it all for?

Vox --

What's your name?

Why would you let me go back?

That was a foolish thing to do.

Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.

May I help you?

I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?

Dance with me...

Well there's something new.

Admiration?  My my.

You know, the moment is rather dying here.

All right...

Let's walk through the park...

Alex...?!

My God...

They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --

... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.

Where's the challenge in that?

Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?

Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.

I'm sorry, David.

It wasn't your fault, Alex.

I can't do that --

That's absurd --

You won't say that in a week.

All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?

And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.

Is there a lot of illness?

We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?

I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.

The mud carriers.

It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.

I don't understand.

... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.

You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.

Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.

Oh huzzah, the master's home.

All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.

Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!

And hungry, I'd say.  You had such a long journey.

He said he traveled for two months.

Where do they take them?!

My fowl have polluted the yard.

What did you do at night?

Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --

No, you're safe --

I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.

I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.

You ok?

He's recovering on the third floor.

And what's that?

Yes.

I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.

I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.

The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.

I don't understand...

That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.

My father used to talk about you.

He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.

It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.

You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?

This is really happening, isn't it?

I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.

I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...

Jackie, go play in the snow.

Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...

What for?

What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.

No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.

Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.

You can't be William Starks. He's dead.

But no one knew until after...

[Beat] You bled to death.

I have no idea.

Why?

Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?

What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?

What?

Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?

You were convicted of the crime.

Why, what would you do?

No. I don't want it to.

So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.

Why don't you help me?

I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?

You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.

I'm not gonna let that happen.

William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.

He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.

I tried to kill my wife.

I know you need one when it's really cold.

Becker does? Are you sure?

It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.

Hey, Mister, you need a ride?

Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.

Well, how'd you get here?

No.

Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.

[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.

I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...

You like it?

But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?

Yeah. [Beat] How about you?

Have a good day at work today.

'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.

Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?

I've been better.

You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.

Good God.

We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.

Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!

So how come you don't have any kids?

This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?

I am the great and powerful Oz...

What did ya do?

What?

Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?

Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...

Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.

Can I just ask you one other thing?

So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?

Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?

I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.

We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.

So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?

I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.

Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.

We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?

Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...

Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go.

I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.

Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.

How do I look?

Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.

I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?

I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.

For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.

But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!

Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.

I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.

Louise?  Where are we?

Can I ask you kind of a weird question?

Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.

I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.

Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.

You do?

You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.

Thelma, that is not an option.

Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!

I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!

I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.

How far are we from Mexico?

Shit!

What?!  What d'you think?!

We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.

They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!

I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.

What in the hell is that up there?

You're a good friend.

What?  What are you talkin' about?

Where you goin'?

Yeah... sure did.

You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.

S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.

Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.

Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?

Mary again.

So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?

What's so funny?

Wait a second, I never told you that.

Never met him.

Well then you've got to call her, man.

How the hell did you get here anyway?

Fuck me.  Let's go home.

Got cash.

Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.

You know, clean the pipes.

Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?

Dom Wooganowski. Duh.

Bob, do you remember Mary?

Who?

Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.

I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.

Would you like a glass of tea or something?

Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?

Here's the info you asked for.

You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?

Very nice.

Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.

Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?

Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.

The sawbones?

Why didn't you just tell her the truth?

Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.

Well, it was nice meeting you, again.

I work with retards.

You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.

Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?

A surprise?

How about -- ?

Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...

No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.

Mary ah, forget it.

Fuck!!

Are you okay?

Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.

I get one hundred a day plus expenses.

But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.

Nope. Never been.

Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.

Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.

Jai alai?

Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.

Oh Christ... poor dog.

Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?

Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.

Mainly I work out of Boston.

Among others.

Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.

Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?

No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.

Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.

You what?

Ho-ly shit.

You little fuck.

A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.

No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'

You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.

Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.

So who's the lucky guy?

I'm buying bananas tonight.

You don't think they're too big?

Oh yeah. Fine.

So who you taking to the prom?

And did everything -- ?

Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.

Jeez, Mary... I'm...

We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.

Why not?

Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!

Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!

Is it the frank or the beans?

You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.

Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!

Eh.

Uh-huh.

Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?

Franks and beans!

Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.

Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.

Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?

What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.

He gets it, but he's pissed.

Zorin will eat him alive!

Slow down. Smell that?

Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --

And the second condition?

Max.

How long until the army is ready?

Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?

So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?

Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?

What's happened?

Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.

I was eating that.

Still think Cuba isn't important?

Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.

Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?

You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.

We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.

You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.

That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.

Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.

Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!

Mr. Clear Moon.

Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.

A murder. On the reservation.

You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.

Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.

Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.

Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.

South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?

Six rounds. 357.

Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?

I got one up on ya.

Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?

You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.

Jesus, you alright?

Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!

What?!

But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.

So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --

-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.

Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.

Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.

You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.

You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.

Still after Jimmy?

Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...

I'm a full-blood Oglala.

What's that?

This Clear Moon's house?

This Jimmy's?

Thank you.

Your relatives must've taught you something.

Ray. X22.

Yellow bird... is gonna sing.

I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --

Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.

How so?

Yeah, most likely.

If you were directly above him, how did you see him?

What would?

What would you say, too fast...too quick...

Lieutenant...

That's true. What are you?

I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.

I want it understood.

Well no...inverse order.

...they say you're alright.

That's not what I hear.

I'm not good company. I should be alone.

You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.

Off me or off you?

Looks like a tie.

You weren't gonna say goodbye?

Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.

Tomcats?

I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.

I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.

Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!

Were upside down!

Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!

WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?

If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!

Ohhh Mother!

Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?

Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?

I know!

5000 feet. Speed two hundred.

Well, I don't know. That depends.

The list is long, but distinguished.

You think you can stay up with us.

Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.

Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.

What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?

It's a victory roll.

What the hell is this?

I'm pinned to the panel.

I was a victim of circumstance.

A plaque?

No, we...got our butts kicked.

Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.

ON THE NOSE?

Figured it out yet?

You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.

He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.

I...FORGOT SOMETHING.

You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.

That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...

Yes sir..

Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?

SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..

Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.

We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.

Would you take me back? Would they?

Welcome to Mars.

And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.

What do you want?

The guy's a fucking asshole.

Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!

What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.

Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?

Bob?

I'm with an very important client.

Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.

So, been married long?

I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.

Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.

Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.

You open it.

What is it?

Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.

Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.

On his way.

What, aliens?

Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?

What are you, my father?

You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.

I want that fucker dead.

I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.

It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.

Let me go!

Well...What do you say?

Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?

Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?

Let me finish!

I love you.

Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...

All right.

No options.

Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?

I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!

...What?

Why would I lie to you?

I'm not falling for it.

I said get out!

I thought you didn't like me.

Are you all right?  Are you still you?

The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.

This is the suitcase you gave me.

Yeah, still got one poking around.

How much you think?

You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.

A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.

BACK OFF, BURT...!

You know, up the jeep trail.

Well, we can take my truck then.

He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!

So...now what?

You're really leaving, huh?

You didn't cook breakfast?

Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.

You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.

Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.

Jeez, look at that guy.

Oh, Jesus!!

Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!

Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!

Fuck you!

That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.

Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.

What the hell are they?

God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.

Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.

Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!

You go north, I'll go south.

How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?

But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!

Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!

Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!

Road's in!

I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.

We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.

Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...

You sure this is where it was?

Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...

Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?

I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!

...Where're we goin'?

The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?

And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?

Or this -- is this a significant difference?

I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's --

Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?

What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !

We don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak. Judge Brandeis said it best: Entrapment is a "dirty business!"

Come now. Did you see the gun?

We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.

We have a full caseload, Rog.

...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!

Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?

-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."

Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?

So what're we gonna do?

Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!

You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!

Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!

I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!

You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?

Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?

I embroidered.

A fucking wheelchair?

You do.

Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.

I killed the motherfucker.

But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?

Afraid of what?

No.

I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?

When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?

Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?

I'd l-like to answer the question.

I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --

Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings...

Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?

Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.

To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?

Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?

My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.

"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.

And why was an exception made?

You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...

The phone company was broken up.

You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?

Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.

The stuff we got last night.

Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.

Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.

You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.

Is there a golf course around here?

Did you know Teresa Banks?

Yes...

GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.

QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?

Where is the ring?

Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.

He didn't suffer.

Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.

Lil was wearing a sour face.

Oh, the uncle is missing.

So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.

The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.

A blue rose.

I see. He does talk loud.

No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.

Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?

Maybe, later we could take a look.

What is it?

Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?

I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.

I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?

Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.

The usual, 9:15.

You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...

Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.

Are you going to see James tonight?

Maybe I better start our homework.

I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?

Where are the Cookies?

Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.

I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.

Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.

You missed somethin', Ed.

Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.

Bob.

You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.

Did you make me a tape?

Laura, do you love me?

I've got to see you.

Oh, Laura.

Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.

Laura.

Dad.

Hi, honey, how's Donna?

Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.

Are you sure you're okay?

Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.

Leland, what are you doing?

What are you doing?

I don't know.

Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.

I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.

Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?

Come back as soon as you can.

How good's your intelligence?

If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?

We thought it was just.

...he wants to testify...?

They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.

You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?

In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?

Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?

And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?

Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.

Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?

What book is that?

Objection, we've...

Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...

No further questions.

The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...

Thank you. When Debby...

...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?

You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?

Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.

...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.

You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?

I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...

I didn't do too well for you.

Dr. Gruber...

The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...

The most respected...

We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...

Kathy Price...

You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...

Yes.

What did she say?

I could subpoena him if I had a week.

Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.

Nothing further, your Honor...

I object, your Honor...

Exception!

Why don't you get some rest?

You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...

Thank you.

Hello, I'm calling from...

I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...

This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?

Pardon?

That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...

You know what happened.

I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?

...we, we love her, Dick and me...

But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...

You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.

I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...

We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.

Dr. Gruber.

I want to buy you a drink.

...now who is that...?

...hey, I don't need your charity...

Are you out of your mind...?

To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...

Mick. Mick. Mick...

Right.

Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.

What I'm saying, they're getting some help.

John: gimme a cuesta-ray.

What happened, Joey...?

She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...

Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?

...yeah... good...

What the hell are you doing here?

What are you doing in New York...?

I spoke to her, and everything is all right.

What happened in those three minutes...?

Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?

Looks almost cold now, don't it?

Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.

We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?

Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...

There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.

Hey, you!  Better get outa here!

I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.

They've all stopped at the same time.

We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.

You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?

I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....

Where are we?

I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...

I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.

They've blocked it!

This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!

Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?

That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.

There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!

I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.

Colonel - shooting's no good!

General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.

They don't do much of anything...!

They are living creatures out there.

Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.

We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.

I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.

I thought you'd killed Freddy off.

The nightmares.

Can I read it?

Anything other than the obvious bothering you?

What if it isn't over?

It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.

Doctor...

Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.

I want my kid out of here now!

This is going to give you nightmares.

He's on his way.

Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?

You okay, champ?

What...what is that?

Heather?  You doing okay?

What...happened?

You're right.  That sounds crazy!

Studio B.

Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...

Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?

No, not really.  I...

Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!

He would have loved this.

All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.

I'd have liked to have said goodbye.

Why did we begin this?

Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.

We'll bear off to port and run down wind.

Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?

It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!

Make us proud.

Albatross?

Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?

Ninety-six.

I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.

You know, I never had friends like this.

You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?

I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".

Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.

Listen man, I think I have a problem.

What the hell is going on?

Jesus.

Ya know... "It".

It was so real...

Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.

Shouldn't we turn away?

Can't do it.

Stow away?

So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?

I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.

Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.

Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.

Who is it Philip?

I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.

What?  Come on...

Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.

This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.

Well, that was neighborly.

Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...

You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.

It's outta here!

I'm not gonna kill it.

Swing up, son.

Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.

No.

They are much more than that, sir.

Yes.

Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".

He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.

What's Cao Ben?

Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?

I'm from all over.

This your car?

Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.

Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.

Whattaya mean family?

What's she doin' here?

What is it?

You heard from Reggie?

That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...

Gas?

Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.

So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?

What happened on the charges?

Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?

I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.

Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?

Who was that?... Who know's your here?

Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.

I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.

Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.

Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.

Why we sittin' here, mama?

I'm scared, mama.

Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.

Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?

When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.

Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.

One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...

When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.

That don't smell like a More.

Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.

What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.

How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.

Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.

I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.

I really do think it's the best night of my life.

Who do?

Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.

I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?

Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?

What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?

I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.

You're scarin' me, baby.

You knew my daddy?

God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.

Lula, you there?

I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...

There's worse places, honey.

Let's get ahold a' her quick.

Sailor?

Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.

So where'd you say you was?

Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?

He's the kind liked it.

The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.

Just a place.

Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.

I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.

I knew you'd want it again...

What do you want me to do about it?

How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?

You need to explain it.

Explain it... I told you.

Where? In the leg?

Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.

You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.

I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...

...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?

Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.

Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...

That's just how my brain works, I guess.

Actually... I just want to go home.

You all right, Professor Tripp?

It's the Chancellor.

Emily?

Is that just beer?

Shit.

Wait here. I'll be right back.

Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?

The hood jumper?

Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...

Kind of a sign, you're saying.

No. But I don't think that matters.

I've been trying to finish a book...

Is that in my chart?

She told you about...

Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.

Sara? Hi. It's Grady.

I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...

...reconcile with Emily.

It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.

Well...

They're glass. The buttons.

It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.

You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.

Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?

Whose tuba is that anyway?

Oh.

He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.

Yes.

How's that?

Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.

I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.

Humboldt County?

It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.

Carvel.

This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?

The one that left you?

It feels really... good... here.

I just wanted a little sip.

So, why did you take me up there?

Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.

You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?

Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.

I'm a little worried, James.

Professor Tripp...?

Yes, Hannah?

He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?

And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.

So what are you going to do?

All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.

But where? I need the street.

He cribbed that from Borges.

Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.

So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.

Has he asked to see the book yet?

Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?

No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.

I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?

And the jacket?

This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.

Ouch. How many?

I went and looked at some babies just now.

Did you just make that up?

You don't deserve me, you know.

That's a nice greenhouse.

I need a ride.

Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?

Grady?

Excuse me?

Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.

Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.

Where you stand?

She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.

Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.

No, the dog.

Are you riding with me, James?

George Sanders?

Don't need to think fast to handle beer.

You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!

I was just thinking of... the noise.

Annette? She's good... tense.

I don't know. She won't talk about it.

It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.

It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.

I've got some pictures.  Want to see?

Ah, come on.

Aren't you glad?

It's not what you think.

Nothing.

What are you looking at?

There's a million birds here.

Something like that.

Were you watching me?

What are you writing in that book?

You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.

You don't know?

I haven't broken any laws.

Doesn't everybody?

Cherry?

Too much sun.

Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.

I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?

That's a nasty scratch on your neck.

You sure you don't know nothing about this?

And your new apartment?

Are you taking your medication?

A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.

My daddy lets me sit on his lap.

I don't want to hurt my daddy.

Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?

Why not?

It was just an idea.

But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.

Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?

Will I ever be normal?

Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?

How do they know?

I don't know.

I don't know.

No, I am not going to --

Where?

Don't ever do that again.

What else?

I'm talking about you.

Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?

What's weird about that?

You're quiet at work.

I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.

I'm not easily shocked.

Hey, that was... intense.

Is that all?

Hey, there.

Molested little girls?

Look, you can go now.

Sorry.

Depraved? My mistake.

I'm sorry, Walter.

My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.

I've changed.

And what do you tell yourself now?

Being here, with me.

Most people say the odds are against me.

For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.

It's a bad idea.

I don't even know how to live with myself.

What's this?

Sneak up behind me like that.

I didn't sleep well.

You okay?

Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?

This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.

You got it?!  You got it?

Okay so far.

Lord Almighty.

Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?

Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.

You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?

But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?

You dumb jarhead motherf--

They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.

No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.

Is that it?  Is this right?

Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.

Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.

That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.

Lady, we better fish or cut bait.

Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.

Getting a reading?

You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!

He can still make it.

What kind of light?

When do you have to go back?

But where are you going?

Claudia, aren't you coming?

Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.

It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.

Somebody must live here!

There's nothing much to laugh at.

Find anything?

And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?

And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.

Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?

But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.

Oh, Sandro...

Then why do you say them?

Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.

Claudia, let's get married?

Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?

That's why I asked you...

Sandro ...What's the matter?

No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.

I love you.

I don't love you.

He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?

What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.

My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.

I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.

You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.

They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.

And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?

But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?

It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.

Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.

And who is this?

First let the poor thing have something to eat.

Ettore...

You men are all so dreadful!

Oh, there are as many as one wants.

Why don't you try?

Don't you ever paint men?

Yes, sir. Three times.

What other boat?

And what did they say about me?

Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?

Are you the owner of this place?

But where did you come from?

Zuria?

About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.

Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?

Because I'm getting fat.

I am, there's too much flesh on me.

That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.

Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?

I just heard you.

Well, who in particular?

He's told you?

Where do you meet?

No. I was sick.

Something I ate.

I got sicker.

Yes.

No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!

What do you mean?

Anything?

Are you married?

Would you like to be?

No questions.

Where do you think babies come from?

What things?

How did she know that?

Who?

Do you?

Do you believe she really saw them?

Agnes, did you love your mother?

If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?

Agnes, how did your mother get you?

What the child?

What did you do?

You can tell me.

Yes?

How does she know that?

Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?

You're a mistake.

You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.

Of telling you.

Did you know what was going to come out?

To be a mother?

Why?

And then what happened?

Hm hmm.

Who?

My bed.

A crucifix.

Which one?

Agnes, can you hear me?

I hate him for what he did to me.

She took the baby in her arms?

I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.

Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.

Eve, she strangled a baby!

I don't know.

Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.

Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.

Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.

I'll have it.

It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.

I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.

The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.

Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?

How did she hide it from the other nuns?

Is that normal?

Who was the father?

Could there have been anyone else?

Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.

From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.

She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.

That's absurd!

I was appalled, just as you are now.

Why didn't you take her to a doctor?

It's my affair too.

I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 

What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.

How?

All right, what do you need.

Visitors to the convent.

Do you have a... a diary or a day book?

You lied to me

There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.

We'll see about that.

I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 

Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...

Pipe!

Mary Magdelen?

Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?

The father!

But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.

There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.

Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.

Was it you?

For what?  An abortion?

Before or after you killed the child?

How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.

Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.

I bet you're  -- sixteen!

Well --

Yeah, I've blown school out.

No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.

Yeah.

Shurrup!

Can you fix him for me?

The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.

Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.

Ever seen one of these before?

I don't snore.

Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?

She's a trend setter. It's her profession!

Get him out of here!!

Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.

Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.

Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.

Well ... come on.

Oh!

Gear?

Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?

But that's not like a real person at all.

I bet you don't sound like real people.

That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!

At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!

So you <U>are</U> a man after all.

Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.

And what's it all come to in the end?

Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.

What are you doing?

Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.

I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.

Come on let's get this coffee.

And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!

All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...

Aye, he looks a right lurker.

What are you doing there?

I hope he fell off.

Let's go and muck in.

Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.

What's old got to do with it?

Are you listening to me, Lennon?

Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.

They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.

Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.

Hello.

Well, you look like him.

That's what you tell me.

Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.

You're a window rattler, son.

He's betrayed the class.

Have <U>you</U> lost him?

I've got the stuff. Come here.

Yeah, you want to watch it.

Yeah, down the ... er ...

Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.

Oh, a little savage, is he?

I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.

There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.

Where's Irth?

I don't recognize that constellation.

Activate lifter quads.

Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.

It's... basalt.  Rock.

Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.

I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.

Can we come up?

How do you feel, Dell?

I have recorded the transmission.

Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?

Yes!

Hello, Faust!

You like this shit?

Hurt!  How?

Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?

And when will you be ready to do that?

Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.

It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.

Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?

We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.

It makes me sick to see him like that.

There.  Should be coming through about there.

You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.

Yes?

While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.

We've got six hours left.

It will be.

Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.

What do you mean, no?

What's happening up here?

This is horrible.

What common objects?

You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?

... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.

We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.

What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.

Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.

Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?

If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.

But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.

No, it's coming.

<u>What is it</u>?

It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.

I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."

And what do we do when we find it?

I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.

These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?

We do know that.

All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.

Let's hear it.

Yeah, okay. 

10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.

Hey, can you guys hear me?

Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --

Engaged.

Now what?

Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!

Now what?

Are you <u>crazy</u>?

That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.

No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.

Headache?  Dehydration?

Yeah, it's fine.

Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?

Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?

We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.

Give or take.

Drains right into the Central Reservoir.

Picking up velocity.

Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.

Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.

Oh, man...

How much air-time have I got?

Deal.

If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.

Whoa, wait a minute...

What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?

Alright, okay.  Look...

Hold it, hold it...

Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?

Oh, man.  That's no glitch!

Is this the suit?

She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.

That's what we thought.

They've changed their heading again.

They knocked out the external feeds.

There's still time to back-out.

Thanks.

Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...

I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.

Any luck raising Ackland's party?

Yeah.  Somebody won.

I've found Ackland!

Think I spoke too soon...

So, what do you think?

You have to...

Where'd you leave them?

Jesus.

Hello, there. Who are you?

It needn't be.

I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...

I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...

Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...

Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?

Champion to champion.

What do you mean by that?

Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...

I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!

Then say so.

And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?

No, it's not.  It's for this.

We never met. That's why.

This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.

In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.

You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.

Naturally enough, your understudy.

Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.

Macbeth.

Nothing?

I told her. I sounded off.

- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.

Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?

Many happy returns of the day...

So she seems.

Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!

Thank you.

Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?

Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?

What fire and music?

I must have frightened her away.

Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...

I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.

I wish it were.

Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?

The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...

"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."

You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.

But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.

I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?

You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?

Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.

She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...

It was Fort Sumter they fired on-

The same size?

And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.

There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-

When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.

Adorable. We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop.

She's loyal and efficient-

You all put together?

I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.

It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.

Hello, Miss Channing.

Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-

Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?

You won't forget it?

We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.

I don't expect you to be pleasant.

Congratulations, Eve.

Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.

Did you see it here in New York?

Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.

I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...

I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?

Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?

Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...

Hi.  Hello, darling-

Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.

She's just outside the door.

How much time have we?

How far to the station?

Why should he - and why should you?

Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.

In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!

I remember.

Coming?

Lloyd, what happened...?

- don't run out of adjectives, dear.

We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...

Lloyd, be careful...

After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...

- well? What happened?

"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?

How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.

Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...

That's right, but I don't understand-

I placed...?

"Liebestraum."

"Liebestraum."

Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?

Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?

Miss Caswell?  What?

You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.

This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!

Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.

I said I'm a dying man!

What is it about my writing that's so rotten?

--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.

This is terrific work, if you like rejection.

I hate both parties.

Republican?

Who'd you vote for?

He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.

--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--

I think that's him.

Well, we are trying to ruin his life.

--jeeeeeeesus--

Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--

None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.

--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--

Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 

Five hundred; six maybe.

I think.

You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?

I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?

I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.

The ones who could disburse the money.

What happens when the baby comes?

--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--

--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--

I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.

This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?

--what do you think?--

Anything else from Mr. Throat?

The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--

I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.

You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?

Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.

Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?

Talk about Segretti--

Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?

And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?

Are you sure?

--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--

Anything?

--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--

What else have you got?

Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?

--no--

You think she wants us to ease up on the story?

--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--

Does "they" mean the White House?

And as treasurer, you could release those funds?

--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?

Good work, Ostreicher.

What did you just say?

Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.

Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.

Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.

Good morning gentleman.

I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!

Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.

Me too.  For the most part.

Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.

Come on!  I won't tell.

Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.

You don't like it?

I wasn't making fun of you.

Hi...

Stifler told me.

Onions?

What about the game?!

This isn't the best way to proposition me.

...I've never tried it.

You got it, stud.

I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.

I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.

Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.

You're so big!

I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.

But, but -- what would I do?

Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.

Please, God.  Let this be it.

How do you know that?

Okay.

Dad!  I know!

Yes dad.

That is a <u>nasty</u> story!

Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?

Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.

I'll just say that we had a great night together.

Yes.  No.  Yes.

So you need to change, right?

Shame on you!

SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!

"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."

Oh Kevin -- don't stop!

You're not doing the extra credit problems.

Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.

Yeah.

So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?

You called me to ask me how to get laid?

That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.

You ever hear of something called The Bible?

Feeling better, Oz?

...Guess what?

Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.

Merde! Just missed!

Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -

Merde! I can't believe this!

Actually, I'm waiting for someone.

Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.

Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!

Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?

You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.

Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.

So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.

Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.

This looks familiar...

Serafine...

Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?

Hello?

I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.

Are you crazy!?

What the fuck!? You too!?

I hope they fucking fry us all.

Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?

Didn't even have to ask.

No wonder he let her go.

God. I can't believe it.

Okay. Be careful.

Hey! You shouldn't be down there!

Okay, what the hell are you up to?

Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?

Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!

Claude...?

Another step and he's dead!

We know you were with her.

Not you too -

Uncle Terrence.

All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!

Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.

The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?

Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?

What do you mean, maniacs?

Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?

Not that I know.

Shit. I feel sick.

No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.

What did she say?

Now!

You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.

Saint Severin...

What were you showing her?

Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?

I have to go now, before it gets light.

Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .

Noooo....

Poor Meetoo!

Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.

You never thought of the possibility?

Just what do you think you're doing?!

Come on!

You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!

Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?

No! Well, yes, but

Dmitri?

... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.

I'm getting a chest cold..

I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...

PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --

It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!

Wake up, young lady, that's our train.

But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!

You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...

Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...

Perhaps you could convince her?

What's your name?

Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!

Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.

What do you mean, next?

H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!

Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!

Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?

Stop it, Alvy!

Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.

Alvy, I...

If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.

So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?

Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.

No, um... I was gonna take a cab.

Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.

So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?

I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?

No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-

You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?

Your grammy!

Fifteen years?

Uh, narcolepsy.

Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...

God bless.

Oh, thank you.

Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-

Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-

Gimme a kiss.

And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?

We can digest our-

Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.

I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.

No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.

You- Do you love me?

That's the key question.

I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.

Yeah, bu-bu-but why?

How is it any different?

That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.

Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.

What are you doing?

Oh, you have my body.

Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.

Yeah.

"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.

You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!

I'm home!

Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.

In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.

She said, your name was Alvy Singer.

Oooh.

Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?

It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?

Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?

Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?

Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.

Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...

You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.

Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.

Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?

That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.

Oh!

This is my room.

Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.

Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.

Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.

Bad?

Tsch, a few.

Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.

Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-

without getting... well, let's put it this way...

Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.

What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.

Ah.

Forget it, Max.

Max, the city is terribly worried.

How about a ginger ale?

If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.

Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.

Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.

Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?

Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!

Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.

Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.

Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?

Now, don't let it be so long, now.

M'mmm.

Oh.

Oh, gosh.

We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.

There's a whole wing in this house.

How long have you worked for the Therrians?

Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?

Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?

Had a little help?

Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?

Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.

The movie.

I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.

Any thoughts on casting yet?

Scratch the two, write in a four.

You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.

She already has.

You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.

You don't have any clothes on.

I don't know how to make her funny.

What what's about?

Why didn't you bring him?

Oh.

It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.

And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.

You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.

Never.

What is that thing?

Oh.  Do you have any pictures?

Thanks for coming.

Escape hatch.

So?

And?

Oh yeah...

I call that a perfect day.

Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.

Just every once in a blue moon, you know.

Hey.  Thanks, buddy.

We closed.

I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.

How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?

Take your time, Jer.

No luck.

Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.

And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.

I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.

Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.

Otis!  No barking!

In the kitchen.

Yes.

Okay, knock it off.

Not properly watered.

There are fucking coyotes out there.

It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.

Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.

Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.

It's not like this all the time.

Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.

Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?

Cal, too?

Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.

I know.

Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?

That's under lock and key.

They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.

Not long.

And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?

Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.

Something soft.

Sally did all this herself?

Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.

Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.

A little out of my element.

I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.

It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.

Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.

Stop being such a bitch, Sal.

Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.

Jesus Christ.

They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...

Are you making an ass of yourself?

What?

Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.

Come on in.

Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.

Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?

How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?

Will champagne help?

How?

They're not just our business managers, Panes.

It's our anniversary, Panes.

Everyday.

Why not?

Well, something's wrong.

I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.

In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.

It's much more personal in here.

Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.

Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.

His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.

I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...

You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!

General -- we have to talk sometime!

You're right!

You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?

You dance...

I order you to find out where we are!

Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!

Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?

Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...

Z!  what are you doing?

I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.

We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!

Bala!

Z!  Over here!

Barbatus!

Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!

Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.

Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.

Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!

Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?

So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?

Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.

Affirmative.

...Not enough food?

Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?

Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.

'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.

Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...

What did I tell you?

Morning, Mr. Baxter.

No.

You mean tonight?

You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.

You all right? What's the matter?

I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --

No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?

Your phone.

That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --

I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.

Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?

Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?

You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?

What's your friend's name?

When are you coming home?

Your stomach?

Oh, you're wrong. He told me --

I am. Let me get the cards.

I think I'm going to give it all up.

I don't want it.

No doubt about it.

You are?

I don't like myself very much anyway.

Who was that?

There's a call for you --

You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.

Thank you.

Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?

Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.

I know so. He's a taker.

Here.

Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.

Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.

I never thought he'd do it.

I guess so.

Yes.  You walking to the subway?

Are you all right?

Mind if I come in?

I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.

Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.

Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?

The Vice Squad?

Who?

Where is your apartment?

How do you work it with the key?

How would you like to go tonight?

It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --

You know how people talk.

Well -- I guess so.

So it was.  She threw it at me.

Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --

It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.

My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.

Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --

Naturally.

What's gotten into you, Baxter?

Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.

What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?

No, no -- just had a little accident.

That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.

Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?

Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.

Hi, Baxter.

You can't come in.

Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.

Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?

Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?

There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.

What's her name?

She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --

Any of that coffee left?

She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --

Help yourself.

Where are you moving to?

'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?

A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.

You got a girl-friend?

Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.

Good night?

Say, what's going on here, anyway?

-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?

Tell me again -- what's my name?

Do you know where you are, Fran?

Do you know who this is?  Look at him.

Please -- just let me sleep.

Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?

That's right.

Remember what we talked about?

That's enough, Fran.

You're not being funny.

What do you think?

Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.

Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.

How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.

Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --

Are you there, Fran?

Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.

I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.

I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.

Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?

Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.

I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.

Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.

Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.

Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.

You're out of your skull --

We've been attacked.

North ?

Sometimes.

How long were you up there ?

A year ? Waiter another beer.

How?

Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.

I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us.

And the grass?

What are we doing here?

You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?

Smoke !

Well, get in there.

I --

Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.

Listen.

Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.

Touchy.

Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?

It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.

Spooky.

What -- happened here.

No, sir.

Yeah.

He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.

A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.

Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.

It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.

Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.

How big it is?

Change.

Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.

Can you trust them?

'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?

Don't you agree?

I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.

And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?

Colonel Kurtz, I guess.

You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?

What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?

Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --

Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.

I think think a lie stinks.

Yes...

And you admired him?

You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --

I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...

Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...

Were you with him, when...

He'll kill us.

Are you finished surfing?

Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.

You hear it again?

What?

Captain Willard?

I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --

Yes.

What if I say no.

I don't know anything about these papers, sir.

Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?

Well who the hell verifies that ?

Well , who's in command here?

Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.

102  CONTINUED:

You talk about ecology -- there it is.

117  CONTINUED:  

134  CONTINUED:

First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.

95   CONTINUED:

113  CONTINUED:

165  CONTINUED:  

Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'

He's coming around fine.

Was there any trouble?

I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?

Let's go.

Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.

Surviving is what I know --

Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.

With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.

Sure love to know where you fit in up here.

There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.

Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?

Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.

I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.

Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!

I already have.

Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.

How come you didn't let him shoot me?

Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?

Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?

What's wrong?

Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?

Alleged killer.

Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.

Why the smirk?

Dead.  Trappers killed him.

Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?

It's Sam Wilder!

This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.

This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.

There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.

Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?

Do you love me?

What? Please? Now? Tell me?!

Only in the emergency room or when he was well.

They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?

It's amazing these things weren't done.

I'm starving.

He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?

An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.

So what are you doing with a dog?

Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.

Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...

This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...

I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.

Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.

Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.

That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...

So you'll be at work?

No, sir...

My son.

Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?

My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.

You wanna dance?

I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...

Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?

If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."

I don't.

What do you want?

I wasn't asleep!!

That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...

I love you...  Let him take you home.

You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?

You changed the room around...

You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...

I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.

Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...

What?

Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.

Sorry. What are those cards?

Terrify me?

Is he dead yet?

Sure thing.

Which color was that?

I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

Go away.

Now we'll both call him.

I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?

I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.

I told you to go on in.

I think you gotta camp it here...

Exactly what is your previous experience?

Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.

Uh, Fontella's

Where you from?

Not too good at small talk, eh?

Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.

Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.

Five million dollars?

I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.

I'm on the scent.

Michael?

They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.

Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.

No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.

Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.

How did he know?

I don't know what the fuck you are.

Deadline?

Who is the mark?

Hello, Robert.

I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.

I know what happened.

I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!

A player?

Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.

You're one of them, aren't you?

He wants to kill you?

And you want to use me to get him?

You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.

Listen -- I don't even know your name.

Yeah.

Because I'm done.

Had?

Some people said that.  I never thought so.

No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.

It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.

I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.

Do you think he's here?

The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.

I've been thinking about it for a long time.

What happened?

What are you doing?

Attraction is a complication?

Did you --

Was she the only one?

Uh-huh.

Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.

Martin.

I'm taking off my mike.

I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.

Why are you working today?

You're very good at this aren't you?

For what?

Do you ever think about starting over?

Then, I'll sail alone.

Don't know.  That's how it works.

How to make a buck!

Fifteen crowns.

Oh yeah, what's that?

Squatted it.

What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.

Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.

Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?

Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.

Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!

No, he was talking about girls, I think.

Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?

Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!

Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.

I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.

Tell them we're working for the University.

Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?

I'd love to get in there.

I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?

Need any disks?

Nope.

Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.

So why didn't we?

No, not if you've got better things to do.

Like a hand?

Do you think anyone will really come here?

Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.

Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.

What happened to Katka?

It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.

It was all in Czech wasn't it.

Yeah, Dave Walters.

If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?

In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.

You're sure?

Yeah, pretty well.

Jesus Holly, we got enough time.

It's that one isn't it.

I've been around.

No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?

I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.

We should be done by the weekend.

So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.

Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?

A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?

But we could go to London and live in England.

It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.

Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.

About forty minutes.

Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!

There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?

Any chance of getting me out on bail?

No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.

I thought I'd help out.

Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.

Seems a shame!

Why are you doing all this, what for?

What's the Bugler?

I figured you more as a Socialist?

A champion of lost causes huh?

Why don't we both forget about him?

This is your doing?

And you broke into that room?

What was the real purpose behind this venture?

Really!

You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.

I'll need to make a phone call.

Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?

And a fifty foot extension lead?

Sure!

So, he didn't fire you?

Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!

Come on Holly!

Shall I look after the rest?

What are you an idiot!

Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.

Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --

I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --

It could help with a new car --

Were you with Jamie?

You do. You're handsome and charming.

That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.

What are you doing here?

I'm thinking.

Hypotheticals --

The address?!

Because, growing up, books were my world.

That's deep --

I know you don't want help.

What the -- ?!

I'm an enemy?

You got some kind of list?

So what else is on this list?

Like you'd know.

No problem --

I'll get something for us to drink --

Because I try to be nice to people?

What is that?

Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.

He doesn't trust you.

The play's going to be really good.

So it's like you want to be secret friends.

Yes. But not as a date date.

It's only 7:30.

It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.

Excuse me?

You're acting like a crazy person.

Assholes. This happen to you?

So what do you want to see?

Can you locate XXI5639I?

Here. Why am I looking at this star?

From citizen high to citizen low.

One of your secrets.

You're worried about your college applications.

Jamie --

Why didn't you tell me?

I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --

Now? We just --

Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --

How you doing?

It's gone now.

What's Landon Carter up to?

Did you give him a gift?

So talk to us about something.

How about your family?

It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.

Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --

Landon. You go on home.

You're marrying again.

For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --

Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.

Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?

Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.

I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?

How was school today?

What time does school start around here?

Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?

Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?

Uh, hi, Eileen.

George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?

I don't want to hit you in the stomach!

How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.

You mean, you're gonna --

Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?

Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!

Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?

Pro, the sun's out!

Catch you later! 

Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....

How did you know?

4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.

I don't recall ever seeing it before.

My guess is that she turned him down.

Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.

Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.

That's just what I needed to hear.

Thanks for everything, Pro.

You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.

Obviously!  

Can you imagine your parents in bed together?

No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.

You promise to stay down there for an hour?

Where'd you get them antlers?

That's what he told you, huh?

Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.

You like people?

No, you're not either.

What's going to happen to Jack and me?

Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.

Nothing.

Hi.

Quit my job.

Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?

My stomach's growling.

Somebody else is going to get it.

That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.

I came in the front.

I can look and see.

"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."

Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.

What'd you put him in there for?

Don't.

Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.

Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.

This your place?

Think I'll take the juice?

All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.

I'm starving...somebody, help.

The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...

That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.

Anybody we know?

Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?

Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?

It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.

All accounted for?  Where's Penny?

And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.

...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...

They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.

Got a casualty list?

He offered you money?

Was she pretty?

Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?

How did she die?  I wanna know.

Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.

I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.

Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.

Stay here, I'll be back.

What's happening with my call to SAC?

Jammed--? By who? Whom by?

How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?

What'd you do before?  Can I ask?

Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.

Any sign of Buckaroo?

Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.

I see.

...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.

Hello, Barton.

Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-

And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-

M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.

How long you been up there, Fink?

Ever talk to him?

...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?

...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?

I'm sorry, I just feel like I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-

I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.

Wuddya got for me  what the hell happened to your face?

Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?

I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.

Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.

Go ahead, son.

Well, I'm... glad to hear that 

Sound a little what?

... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.

And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?

Well ain't that a kick in the head!

Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.

...Got a sweetheart?

...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time 

Because that would mean they gave you mine.

Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?

Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...

Hold on 

Jesus, Charlie, I...

It's more than I've got.

You'll be back?

...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me  Charlie.

...Yes, thank you.

...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?

No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help 

Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider 

Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.

Okey-dokey, go ahead.

...Those your only bags?

Also known as Madman Mundt.

Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.

Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!

All night?

Yeah, I was drinking.

Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.

I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.

Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?

How about the coke?

It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.

I thought you hardly know her.

I had him in two classes.

You should do something about this lock.

Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?

Were you with him last night?

Did you go home with him?

Was there anyone with you last night?

Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.

I told you -- I quit.

But you said you liked men to use their hands.

Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.

Because you didn't love him --

Even though you were fucking him.

Sure.

How do you know all this stuff about me?

Am I... disturbing you?

You tell me.

I like you.

You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.

What did you pay Nilsen?

Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"

I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.

You're in over your head.

I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?

Do you think I told her to kill You?

Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?

Can I talk to you a minute?

I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?

You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.

I have to do some research tomorrow.

No thanks.

I finished my book.

Did you ever tie him up?

How did he die?

I don't really feel like talking anymore.

You workin' on another book?

What kind of drugs?

Was she ever a suspect?

Thanks.

How'd it go, son?

Was she ever suspect?

She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.

I don't think it's funny.

Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.

I don't know.  I'm just not.

Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.

Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.

Maybe it's for old-time's sake.

You're already gettin' psychological input, son.

Were you with him last night?

What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.

First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.

Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.

Why do you think he's dead?

Who are you?

No Lisa Anderson, detective.

He died -- about five or six years ago.

I'm a painter, too.

Of what?

Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.

Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors  anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"

Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.

Ouch..

I'm interested in showing Jean's work.

When?

What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 

... Can you... decipher this for us?

Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.

Paint it out.

You want me to put it here?

Blue? Where?

Check you later, man.

Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!

What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.

No, don't tell me  you just got fired by your crazy boss.

Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.

It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.

I'm your family.

Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.

Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee 

... babies.

Hi.

You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.

How can I ever thank you?

Come on.

I don't eat junk food.

You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.

So shut up and keep painting..

Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...

Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?

I guess this mean we won.

Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.

I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.

Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...

I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?

Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...

I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.

If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.

My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.

Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.

... eight, seven...

Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.

I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...

Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.

I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...

How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?

You have?

Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...

Women.

First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.

What is it?

This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.

Youwsa!  Nothing but air.

This is easy.

You're loosing your cool

Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.

You think Freeze will take the bait?

Pull back.  You can't make the jump.

I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.

Umm-hmmmm.

Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.

We gotta get those locks changed.

What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?

Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.

Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?

Wild doesn't exactly cover it.

You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?

I need the Wayne Diamonds.

Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.

Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.

I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.

One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.

No gun.  How disarming.

You will rescue my wife

There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.

I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.

That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.

One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?

Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.

You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.

Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.

...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.

Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.

How are you feeling, young man?

Old habits die hard. Are you alright?

...A bat.

All the answers are numbers.

What now sir?

_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?

Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.

Now black rubber.

We all wear masks.

You are direct, aren't you?

I haven't had much luck with women...

Help Chase. I'll be back.

Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?

Wait. I have a riddle for you.

I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?

Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?

We'll talk some other -

What? Oh, it's very impressive.

La'chiem.

Rinka.

I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?

It's a stretch but I'll manage.

That kid is amazing.

Fast work. You just moved here.

Find anything interesting?

Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.

And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.

There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...

Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.

Chase?

Holy shit.

Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.

Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.

Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.

A-14.

B-12.

Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.

Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.

Please.

What is that?

They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.

Do you want a drink?

Odd desire for anyone.

As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.

I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.

But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --

To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.

Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.

Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?

Keep her on the line!

I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --

How can you do that if she's already off the line?

I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.

I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.

Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.

I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -

It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."

It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.

All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --

... Thank you.

I've seen worse.  Much worse.

I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!

How'd you know it was me?

God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.

Where does one man get all this junk?

Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.

You are on drugs.

Are they paying you for all this?

Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??

There aren't hotels?

It's the last thing we need.

I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...

Jesus.

There were three strawberries.

Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...

Sort of half.....

shhh...

Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.

Goodnight Annie.

Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.

Oh yes.

I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.

Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.

Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!

He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.

Ah... He certainly has something, sir.

Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.

You're not going to ....

Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...

Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.

Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  All Englishmen are ugly.

You arrange those flowers yourself?

Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.

Is Jenny gonna be okay?

Doctor Jacobson?

Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.

Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?

That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.

Beavis. This is what it's all about.

Dammit, all they have is shows about water.

That was boring. Huh huh.

That's not that much.

Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.

Whoa, my life is cool!

Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.

Well where is she?!

I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.

Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.

Turd-burglar...

Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...

I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...

Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.

Uh, we didn't score yet.

They look like a couple of kids chief.

You see what I see, Bork?

You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?

Cavity search...?

We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.

Do her? Huh huh.

She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.

Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!

Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.

You scored with two chicks?!

Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...

You got two seconds!

Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?

You'll be rich!

She's ready.

Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.

Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.

Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.

I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.

I don't think we survived the crash.

There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?

Cabin fever, hon?

Maybe this is heaven.

God, it's Jane Butterfield!

Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'

Oh, honey, we may need that.

Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.

We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.

Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.

That little girl saw us.

We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'

My God, we're back where we started.

We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.

Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?

Here's something.

And your sushi was remarkable.

N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.

<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?

Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...

What time is it?

What?

We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.

What is going on?

We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...

Nine months?  What difference does that make?

Help vouchers?

Wait for who?

You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?

<u>Barbara</u>?!!

<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!

I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.

You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!

-- Like you used to be?

I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!

How'd you do on the science test?

No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.

You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?

W... What is it?

Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!

Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.

Otho?

I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.

Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!

Dad.  Do you believe me?

Stepmother's...

Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --

The attic room is locked --

Are they suffering?

Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.

<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.

What do you think?

Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.

'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?

I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.

Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.

Are they still here, Otho?

It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.

Perhaps if I were properly motivated.

The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.

Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?

He does, does he?

... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.

Yes. I love Eve very much.

At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.

... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...

Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.

Oh. I have a message for him.

A Black man gave me the message.

Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?

Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?

Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.

... Good night, Chauncey.

Chauncey!

Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?

Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?

I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?

Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.

Oh, I like that very much.

... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...

Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?

I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.

Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!

Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.

Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.

Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?

Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.

A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.

... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...

Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?

Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?

Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...

Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?

Does it have a television?

... That is a very small room.

Yes. I've seen that done.

... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...

Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?

Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?

... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.

Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?

How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?

Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.

The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.

Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.

Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...

Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?

You heard?

... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...

Yes? What have you found?

Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.

And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.

I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.

This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.

So...? Where the hell is it?

What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?

I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.

Ben!

You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.

You take care too, Bobby.

I never played a jewel thief.

I don't know.

Morning.

What?

Which one is Elijah again?

They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.

Yeah, just an idea I had.

The iguana.

No thanks. I'm going to turn in.

I'll meet you on the turnpike.

Why aren't you at work?

What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.

How was it?

So how was it? What was he doing?

I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.

You were him last night, weren't you?

And he was with her.

I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?

Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.

You fell in love with her first.

I need a shower.

It's Elijah.

Security.

Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...

You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am

Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.

Yes, well...

Buy you a drink, Maxine?

I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.

No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...

So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.

Hi.

It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.

There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.

Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.

Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!

Lotte? Is that you?

Let him try.

What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?

But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.

So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!

You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.

Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.

Impressions? Those are hard.

I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.

No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.

What kind of circumstances?

Floris, get Guinness on the phone.

Thank you, Floris.

It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.

Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.

I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.

Anybody else?

But of course.

Oh, be still my heart.

But now we've lost access to Craig.

You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.

Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.

Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?

Yes?

J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.

But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.

Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.

She's not available.

Who's calling?

Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.

Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!

Come on in.

Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.

I'm getting better all the time.

You still there, sweets?

Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.

No one would ever have to know its not him.

Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.

Sleepy suddenly.

Bad dream, darling?

Honey, we can be happy and poor together.

Good-bye, Maxine.

Captain Mertin?

Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.

The Word. What you was put here to speak.

YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?

You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!

You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..

Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...

Your mother all right?

You think she sure 'nough your sister?

Well, if you want my opinion...

Well, good luck with the job.

Yes?

What you want?

Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.

Be here. In case.

They good whitefolks?

I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.

She likes to see you off in the morning.

No...no...no..

What you want there? Somebody invite you in?

I know what I see.

Can't locate him.

Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!

Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-

I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.

You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.

Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.

This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.

Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.

Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?

You don't know what I think.

Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...

Sethe?

Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...

Yeah?

Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.

Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.

Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.

Where'd she been?

I know my rights.

That guy treats women like objects, man.

Jesus fucking Christ.

There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.

This is a hundred and eighty dollars.

Sheesh.

Where you going, Dude?

I was bowling--

I am the Walrus.

Burkhalter.

And then they're gonna stamp on it?!

What do you need that for, Dude?

What have you.  We'll, uh--

--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."

That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--

They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--

One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?

Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.

Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?

Which one was Logjammin'?

Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?

Is that what that's a picture of?

You mean coitus?

A hundred.

Oh that's okay, I hardly even--

Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.

Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?

Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.

Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?

What happened to your house?

Jeffrey--

What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.

So who--

Yeah, but--

Theodore Herzel.

Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?

Hey man--

Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.

That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.

Just for making the hand-off?

...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--

I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.

Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.

The what?

We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--

Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--

FUCK.

Walter!

What the fuck?

You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!

Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--

That's it.  I'm out of here.

"Our" car, Walter?

I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--

Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--

Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!

I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.

Thanks Walter.

Uh-huh.

Is this your homework, Larry?

You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--

I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?

Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.

Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!

Well can we--

We're scattering the fucking ashes!

Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!

What about that shit about Vietnam!

WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!

Dude.

Is this a--what day is this?

Ah fuck it.

'Scuse me?

Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?

Brandt, give him the envelope.

Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.

Shit, sorry man.

Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.

<i>You'll</i> take him.

He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.

What about Nomak?

Recognize him?

He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.

Thank you.

It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.

Why do you hate us so much?

How does it look?

You came back for me.

I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.

I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.

Your security's for shit, kid.

What's your problem, Whistler?

I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.

The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?

And why is that?

What's going on?

Nomak?

Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!

Any casualties?

Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?

You're wasting your time, already been tried.

Nope.  Back then we did not.

Pretty.

Whistler!

She's been bitten.

I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --

Don't try to talk --

The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.

You're too human, Blade.

The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."

Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.

Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.

What am I injecting you with?

Any progress?

How long have we been driving?

Get out of here --

What happens then?

There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --

Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.

Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.

I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --

What happened to the power?

I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.

What do you mean?

--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--

Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.

--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!

I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--

--I'm not staying here!

Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!

Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."

Why are we here?

This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!

Hang you like the witch you are, unless--

Jesus.

No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--

--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?

--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--

Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?

No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.

You want me to scooch over next to you?

I'm not going anywhere, 'til--

We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--

--hours before--

<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?

Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!

It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!

So, I hear you're from New Mexico!

This is a little nuts.

Does it hurt?

--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--

I don't believe this.

Never would've guessed.

What movies?

Me, too.

Mi casa y su casa!

Where's Domini?

She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.

You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?

Where?

What the fuck--??

--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--

We're not making Blair Witch II here.

Cotter?

Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?

They're making "Blair Witch II," too.

<u>What</u>?

Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?

What--

--whatever you want, no problem--

Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.

Oooh. Oooh.

That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....

Women miscarry all the--

That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.

What'd you see?

The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.

What?

We are being fucked with here, someone or something.

Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--

She's far from "fine."

Good morning, Sheriff's Office.

Your mother's pastor.

There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.

Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.

Thanks, Meurice.

...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.

What?! Did Ray tell you that?

...Ray?

What was that?

Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.

Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.

When you don't they're usually nice.

Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.

...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?

...But first I gotta know what happened.

...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--

If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?

He needs a room, Dusty.

Sure don't.

Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?

Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?

...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.

...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.

...What're you gonna do in Houston?

...You know that car?

Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?

You want me to kill 'em.

Well what?

...What?

Dead, huh?

Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?

What's this?

Deuce in the corner needs help.

This.

The point is we don't serve niggers here.

Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?

Got a problem, Meurice?

Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?

Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?

I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.

Come into the study a minute.

Jeffrey?

Is that why you say it's horrible?

Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.

Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?

Is Sandy part of this?

For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.

Can I feel 'em?

Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.

GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?

Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.

Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.

Hi. can I come in?

Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.

I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?

It used to make me laugh .but.

Yes. Frank-

Do you like my body?

Look, snap out of it, will ya?

I'm glad you do.

Who, Dorothy?

Yeah, how did you know?

How is Central these days?

I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.

What do you know about the ear?. anything?

It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?

Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?

I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.

I'd like to talk to you about something.

I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?

You really want to do this, don't you?

Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.

Brilliant.

O.K.

Okay. yeah, call.

What did you see?

I'm sorry, I didn't.

You're sure right. It is a strange world.

I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.

You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.

Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.

Everything okay?

You didn't tell him about me?

Okay.

What was that all about?

It's okay.

My father has a gun at home.

Dorothy! ... Dorothy!

What time are visiting hours?

I'm going out for awhile.

Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?

Would you like a piece of cake?

It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.

Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.

Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.

QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?

I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?

On the plane.

Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.

The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.

Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.

I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.

Blanca, por favor.

Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.

We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.

You wanna split?

Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.

George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.

Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?

Why are you speaking?

What can I do for you guys?

The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.

Goodness.

It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.

I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.

If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?

I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.

Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?

Good to see you, Diego.

Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.

Please, continue.

I know.

Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.

Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?

There's no room.

I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?

Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.

I did not.

Cocaine?  How much?

Well, you know.  It's um...

Surprised to see me?

Mexico.

So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?

I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.

Diego?

I know.

She's angry.  It's all over the news.

You're not going to trial?

...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.

How are you doing, George?

Figured it out.

George.

Look what the cat dragged in.

Do I know you?

I don't know.  My name is George.

You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.

Where are you going?

What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!

Not in front of the kid.

Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?

Hey, George.  You okay?

I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.

Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?

California, huh?

I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?

I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.

But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.

Because she's visiting me.

Do you see him here in the courtroom?

You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.

For instance, something like this?

Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.

I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.

Are we good?

But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...

What's happened to you?

But I haven't shot him.

What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.

I don't do that kind of thing.

Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...

What do you think of the strike, Ali?

No, and neither were my men.

Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.

All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.

We'll lower a basket from the window ...

I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?

You did a good job, Charlie.

Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.

What about the will?

Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.

The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.

Then how did it get into his body?

Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?

What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?

Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?

Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.

He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.

No questions.

That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.

Can you?

I'll tell her but she won't take it.

What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.

Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.

Can I go?

Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?

Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?

Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.

Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?

Why did you come by?

You wouldn't know her address, would you?

Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?

Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?

How long were you together?

How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?

When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?

Can you give the court an example?

She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.

What happened after that?

Where did you meet Miss Lawson?

What kind of information?

Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?

Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?

--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?

Why does she come to you?

Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?

What did you prescribe for her?

Then what happened?

Did he make your life miserable?

What did he say?

If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?

Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?

Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?

I suppose.

What do you have in your purse?

I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.

Frank!

Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.

Why not?

That's not an answer.

Nothing.

Hi, Frank.

Yeah.

I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!

I called you all weekend.  Where were you?

Something wrong?

Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.

You killed him -- didn't you?

You don't need anybody.

Hello?

What are they saying?

Because I'm expecting a call.

Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.

If you want me to.

Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.

She sounds like quite a woman.

Humped

Yes.

You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

I know.

I don't know.

Don't use language like that at the dinner table.

I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.

Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.

Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."

Oh, just a old letter from a friend.

I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.

Yeah.

What?!

Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.

What?

Don't say that!

Well, I'd like to read them.

Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"

Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.

Not this kind of heat.

Madge?

Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.

I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.

Pretty country.

Are you by nature a sadistic person?

Oh, that's nice.

Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.

About a year and a half.

Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.

Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.

Smells like dirt.

Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?

You really don't need anyone?

No, I'm just saying --

My mistake. I apologize.

I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.

Listen, I'm sorry I --

Francesca?

Am I interrupting anything?

I'll pick you up.

Okay. See you later.

Oh.

Sorry I'm late. Richard called.

Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?

Can I help?

Would you like a beer for your bath?

Take me somewhere.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I just wondered. Why were you trouble?

I can't do this, honey.

I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.

Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.

What about your husband?

Franny?

When did she decide this?

Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.

Don't feed that dog.

Is it true?

Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.

Are you nuts?

You didn't hear that?  "Take him... " Something.  "Bury him" or...

Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.

You soundin' like the old man now.

Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.

You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.

Is this Hell?

Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.

Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?

You got a nice crib here.

I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.

I said, no thanks.

I want you to do something for me, baby.

But.

Sorry, my brother.

They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.

Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.

We'll have to sneak in.

What else does she say?

Lucky thing.

And you believe her?

We're here.  Where the hell are you?

What are we doing down here?

No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.

I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.

I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.

You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.

Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.

What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.

That's all we did, steal their ride.

Then how'd you hear it, fool?

I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.

Jimmy Bones?

You haven't?

And some people need their medication tweaked.

... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.

Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.

There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.

Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.

Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.

Where is this going, Johnnie?

How the fuck can I open it?

You don't think I'll do it, do you?

We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.

Caesar, I'm leaving.

Just look at this mess I got to deal with.

They were early.

That doesn't make any sense.

No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.

He didn't see you, did he?

You can't leave.

I saved you.

Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.

Caesar, don't.

Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.

Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?

I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.

You got the key?

Call me as soon as you get him.

See?  We're for real.

This is a beautiful place.

So this is temporary for you?

Are they really?

I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.

Do you have a pot or a bucket?

Okay, one drink.

Are you surprised that I know what it is?

No.

Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?

No.

Five years is a long time.

What's wrong?

What are you afraid of?

I don't understand - ?

Because it's the truth.

What you heard wasn't sex.

All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.

For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.

Caesar is going to get the money and bring --

These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.

Gino Marzzone.

Has Caesar ever seen him?

What time did you say they would be there?

Where will you be?

There is no going back.

I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.

I'm sorry, Corky ...

Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!

Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!

I know you will.

Yes.

<u>This is an operations desk</u>.

That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.

No.  We can't risk it.

We don't know what we're into!

What do you mean?

Paris.  I live in Paris...

Yes.

I think so.

<u>What did you do to me</u>?

I know you've been trying to kill me.

Jason Bourne is dead.

I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?

Sir, you waited on line.

...yes -- oui -- uh...

Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.

D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --

Was it the break-in?

Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.

I need a ride out of here.

What does that mean?

Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...

Four-fifty.  That's the address...

Okay, so...

Look, I don't know what's up there.

What? -- what? --  -- what is it?

-- just --

Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --

He came to kill us.

Oh, Jesus...

But the police --

-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --

<u>So what are we doing</u>?

And that's it?

You have ID?

Where did this body go?

Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --

Get in the basement.

<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --

-- Miss Kreutz, please --

What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.

It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...

-- what're you talking about? --

You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.

You drink rum?

... And then some.

...ixed itself.

... fix themselves.

I think we'd better have a look.

What have you got there?

Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?

Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.

Go away.

Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?

But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...

Thanks very much Sam.

If I can help you ...

Please, I've got to find Jill.

Sam!

Remember how they used to stick out?

Layton! Oh shit!

You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.

OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.

What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.

But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...

Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.

Out of kindness.

You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?

Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.

She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.

You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?

Stamped?

You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?

Bloody hell! Do as I say!

Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.

It's heavy.

Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?

We've got both.

Who is this war against, Sam?

How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?

Turn around!

Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 

There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?

I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.

........... It's a bomb isn't it?

What happened to you after ...

What do you think? ... is it me?

What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.

Tuttle?

Try next of kin.

I know that.

What?

You want to take my console into your office?

Hey - that's my desk!

Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.

What were we saying?

It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.

It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.

Uh ...

Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.

Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer

My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.

I don't know which numero.

Yes?

No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.

Now look what you've done to him.

But we can get one.

Sign here please.

Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!

What is it?

Ha!!

Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.

You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.

I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.

I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?

No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.

Is she dying?

Hey Cy, guess who's here?

Frank, take it easy. what happened?

She asked me to pick her up.

That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.

What about Kanita?

Okay, what happened?

IB Bangin.

That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.

Here, you try.

I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.

He's dead, huh?

He's better, isn't he?

I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.

I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.

Five years.

I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.

If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.

I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.

What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.

I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.

Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.

This is not a good time.

Who is it?

You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?

Who's that?

Three legs.

You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.

I hate vodka.

What do you think?

The family know?

No.

Where's Burke?

These are hard times, Tom.

Mr. Oh.

Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.

Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!

Let's get in a fight, then.

We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!

No we can't. He's got a pulse.

They'll just keep calling.

Well why didn't you say so?

Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.

Never to pretend to know more than I did.

Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...

Yes.

This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.

Wait.

No.  Don't worry about it.

What did they do with you?

You packing up tonight?

Hold it down, okay?

Hi.

I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --

You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.

Eventually rising to...

You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?

He must have been great-looking, right?

To the pan of the supplies boxes --

I write for you sometimes.

Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.

Did you bring your grey suit?

I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...

Yes.

No.

If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?

I don't know.  I may be in love with him.

What?

Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?

You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...

Ready.

Do it then.

Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?

Just a few questions?

All this business of war -- do you get scared?

I was a little nervous there for a minute.

Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.

But thanks.

You don't have time.  Not a chance.

What did he say?

What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.

Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'

Do you want him all the way to the car?

I really have to go.

Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.

What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?

Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.

...good-bye then.

Why so glum?

As long as that's your only problem you're...

Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.

It's not opinion.

Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.

Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?

It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.

They said it would be okay if...

I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.

I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.

So he was indicted?

Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.

At work there's always this sort of film over you.

You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.

You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'

I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.

No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?

Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.

So you like me, huh?

So what did you think?

It's incredible who's here.

You okay?

I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?

What happened?

It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?

I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.

Uh-huh.

Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.

No.  Did he really?

Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.

Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...

You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...

Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.

Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.

This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?

I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.

Are you okay?

What are you doing here?

Walter can I ask you something?

See you later -

Don't worry about him...what have you got?

I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -

Look at the size of it!

I know what it is to be ignored.

Of course I do!

I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?

It was.

Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.

Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...

Murdered...man?...

What's the matter with you?

What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?

It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.

Yeah, can you say plagiarism?

But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!

I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?

Now what kind of statue was that?

Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?

Walter, what are you doing?

Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?

Yeah.

No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.

Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.

H-have a seat?

It's hot in here...

You might talk too much.

What do you have in the box?

I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...

What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.

Yes, you have.  Can I come in?

Did you see my cat?

I also saw the girl give you this.

But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.

I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!

Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!

Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!

I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -

Are you done with these?

And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?

An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...

With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.

It's like...you've turned on.

Well, I'll go home with you.

Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?

Walter have you been talking to yourself again?

Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!

I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.

Man has a complex.

Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?

You're the guys from the movie!

Hey!  She wasted my dog!

Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.

I'm fine.

I... feel.... pretty.

Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!

Oh, my God.  Is that true?

Do you know what time it is?

Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...

Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.

Something like that.

What show is this?

Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.

Buffy, what are you doing here?

No, you didn't.  When?

I am a God!  A God!

Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?

How are you doing?

You want some water or something?

You sure?

Pike, I don't think you're up to this.

Buffy?  What's wrong?

You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.

It is a pretty crucial subject.

Like what?

I don't see why we have to invite everyone.

You were supposed to be here at three.

I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.

God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.

What are you talking about?

I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.

Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.

It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.

Why do you keep saying that?

Oh, him.

Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?

Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.

Sporting events, yeah.

Here?

But you threw a knife at my head!

Oh.  Sorry.

Put your head back.

If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?

Same one.

What!?!

He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.

I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?

Football is my life.

None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.

Wait!

Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.

Come one, that was so weird.

That is so cool.

Well, I guess you got what you came for.

I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.

Why?  Why me?

I can't believe they still ate it.

Omniplex?

What happened?

Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.

Oh, God.

Environment.  That's cool with me.

What are you talking about?

So, we're stupid now?

It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.

What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?

All right.  Take care of yourself.

Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...

I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.

God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--

You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--

I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!

Fundamentals?

Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.

No!  You're playing with my mind!

Neither will I.

--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.

You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".

I'm Crash Davis.

After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.

I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.

I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.

Your place or mine?

A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--

I think of you and the "boy" all the time.

I doubt that.

Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.

I don't know if I'd go that far.

...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?

Ninety-five miles an hour.

Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--

God bless you.

Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.

Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.

Did you call me a cocksucker?

Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!

Fastball.

He did know.

How come you don't like me?

What do I got?

Party without me.

I was great, eh?

You're a great catcher.

No.

Sorry about last night.

I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?

Step outside, pal.

Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.

Little high.

Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?

Eight and twenty-four.

Patkin was a tribute to baseball...

Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?

What'you want, kid?

Who ain't?

Thank you.

I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.

Look at yours.

...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.

It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...

I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...

Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.

You got it.

Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.

...stupid things.

No, you're not calm.

She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.

M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?

...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.

Amy! Amy, open the door!

Dad!

Mommy.

When did this happen, honey?

You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?

...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.

But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.

He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.

I'll take Columbia for twenty.

...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.

Okay, Sammy.

Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?

No, of course not.

Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.

Ohh!

Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.

...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.

So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?

Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.

No, no it's okay.

I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.

Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.

What happened to me? What happened to you?

All right.

Please...

Peekaboo, you fucks, you.

...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.

You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!

What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!

Ginger called me.

...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.

Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?

You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?

You go and put your things away.

Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.

But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.

He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.

Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.

Why not make them happy?

Fuckin' asshole won't budge.

This woman's an institution.

I'm going to go powder my nose. 

Okay, thank you for asking.

Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.

I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.

Understand?  I'm sorry.

If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?

Why're you crying?

It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?

You sure?

Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.

Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.

You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.

Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?

You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?

You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?

I didn't take your pills.

You didn't have to beat him up!

Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.

You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...

What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?

It's under...

Yeah.

...the rest of the two million is still there?

Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.

Yeah.

Get off of me! Stop it!

You're lower than a dog!

Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.

I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.

I put her to bed.

Oscar wants you to call him.

To the Riviera.

I had a... salad.

She had the same.

I mean, it could get us both killed.

I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.

I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -

Should I let her in like - ?

Okay, I'll -

You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?

Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!

This is not the way to treat people.

Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.

No, Sir.

Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.

I just wanna get out of here.

A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.

Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?

So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.

Yes.

Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.

Can I go in?

What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.

Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.

Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house.

Come on. I'm sorry.

You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?

Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.

Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.

Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.

Carmine left?

He's not here?

Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.

Artie!

Artie! Artie!

We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -

Hey, Frankie.

...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?

Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?

You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?

But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.

Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']

Uh-huh. Good.

Tell me.

Sure.

Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?

I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.

He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?

You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?

You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.

So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?

I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -

Yeah.

I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.

I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!

Come on.

Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.

You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.

There's more!

There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.

Hey, how you doin'? 

Wow.

Incredible.

...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.

Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.

And this is Stacy.

I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.

Fine. Everything's goin' good.

Yeah, thanks a lot.

...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.

Mm.

He's here.

He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.

Nah. You would've heard somethin'.

Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.

Don't know.

Take it easy!

Charlie M?

Tony.

I'm positive.

...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.

What's the matter with you?

Again!

That's enough.

...done right, you gotta do it yourself.

Yes, uh...

Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...

The crowd bought it.

Works for me.

Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...

Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.

Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..

I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?

I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?

Are you sure?

Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..

Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.

Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?

There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.

Selina, are you okay?

Catwomen. Lots of them!

Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.

Yeah, this is better than rape.

Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.

God-damn..

The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?

I loved you.

My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.

I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...

Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...

How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!

Yeah, she's okay.

How much?

I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...

You are...

Okay, deal.

Nice breasts.

What was that for?

So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?

I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?

Lady, don't let him do it!

How do we get back to the freeway?

He's seen both of us now.

Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.

You never miss a trick.

Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!

I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.

And stop with the directions.

In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.

Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.

Nels, don't let that cop pass you.

Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.

Nels?

Who smashed the phone?

Why would anybody want to hurt you?

The cops could trace this call back to you.

What makes you say that?

Who?

Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?

Stop throwing names at me.

26th off Wilshire.

I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.

Our house always needs touching up.

I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.

I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.

How come everybody turns out to be a crook?

It won't be him.

Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.

Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.

Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?

Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.

I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!

Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.

Who's in back?

Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.

You were at the Emerald that night?

He wants 75 back.

What's Nels' number?

You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?

Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.

What's your point?

Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.

I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.

Thank God -- thank God I've got you.

You're making it too easy.

I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.

308-9962.

You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.

I'm here.  Where are you?

I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.

We're waiting on you.

Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.

Yeah.  Why don't we?

What's he doing?  Answer me!

Who am I talking to?

If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.

You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.

Where's the backpack?

Why are you picking on me for?

I already called for an ambulance.

Can I make a quick call?

The 405 is coming up.

You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.

Scottish?

She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.

When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.

He agreed that he was.

That's what he said. Jimmy.

He's still looking, Col.

Ask him.

Fuck off, Dave.

Don't be like that --

Look, I'm sorry.

Do you mean that?

No, of course not, she's a lady.

Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?

Who?

Doesn't the water get to your nails?

No.

Tell her I'm very happy with it.

Jimmy.

Everybody wants something.

What'll it be?

As different as it's possible to be.

No --

I think you do.

Maybe.

So what do you want with me, Jimmy?

You mean that?

You're something else, Dil, you know that?

Sure I do.

I didn't mean to hit you.

I should have known, shouldn't I?

Kind of wish I didn't.

It's her, isn't it?

Shouldn't be, Dil

Do you like me even a little bit?

You do something for me, Dil?

You're no good at this, Jimmy.

Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?

So tell me.

Good-bye, Dil

See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.

Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here

You like me now, Jimmy?

Promise?

Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -

Have a look at him.

So you did fuck up.

You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.

We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.

Leave her out of this.

We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.

Jude?

Who's the old geezer?

So he knows your name?

Who is he?

So it's on the street.

You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.

Thank you, handsome.

No?

You're going to have to do it, aren't you?

What do you know about my nature?

Shut the fuck up, would you?

No, what's the funny thing?

Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.

She your wife?

You make a nice couple.

That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?

Never.

Can't.

Why?

Having two pints in the Rock.

Oh, yeah.

Depends on what you believe in.

She can't help it.

You liked her?

Go to sleep now.

Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --

Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?

And you know what?

All right -- where's the letter?

It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.

Adam!

I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.

Lord, you're stubborn.

as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!

Now what?

Reggie -- stop!

But I didn't kill anybody.

Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.

You didn't have to chase me so hard --

I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?

Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.

To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.

Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.

Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.

And I'm afraid we want it back.

We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.

I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.

Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?

What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?

He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.

He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.

Steal it how?

Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?

He looks so young -- when was this taken?

No.

Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?

Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?

You'd lie about anything.

Why you lied to me.

Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?

Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.

Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?

Sure.

Is there a Mrs. Dyle?

What are you doing?

Who told you to do that?

But I'm not through complaining yet.

Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?

Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.

Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.

Reggie -- open the door.

Then I suggest you call one of them.

What are you doing?

I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?

Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.

Why don't you shut up!

When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.

What for? If it's not here, why bother him?

You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.

Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.

Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?

Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --

Yes.

We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?

He was American?

Oh. Swiss. His profession?

Where did he keep his money?

Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?

Of course it is.

Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --

I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.

Up there! It is up there!

Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?

Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?

He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?

Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 

Clever fellow -- almost missed me.

Peter Joshua.

Well, you're honest, anyway.

It's terrible -- you just made it up.

Where did everything go?

You mean you and me?

You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?

On the street where you live.

How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.

I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.

Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?

Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.

Stop that!

Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.

It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.

Do you know him?

I'm glad. But what's all this?

We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!

Howdy, Miz Lampert.

Why?

Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.

Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.

One more time.

Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?

It's almost ten o'clock.

You said that two weeks ago.

Hi honey.

I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.

Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!

Ok.

You were eavesdropping.

You found her?

Can you get inside?

I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.

No, you couldn't.

Really?

I know where you're going.

We just found another body.

Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.

Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?

You aren't going to the party?

Me? Why me?

_ Your father raped someone?

Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.

The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.

You ok?

You can't tell your parents.

Unless he makes a move during seventh period.

Don't you think it's sick?

Why?

If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.

What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?

You flaunt some slut in my face.

Jody. Wait.

Hi mom.

Mom?

Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.

Who?

Two men left town right after it happened.

Yes?

There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.

Hey! That was a 3k machine.

On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.

Unbe-fucking-lievable.

Damn.



Come on, Night Shift.

A little early for a delivery.

Where do you want this stuff?

That's my business.

Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?

Sorry, man.  He's dead.

You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...

All right.

I got, uh....

...-ed.



...town. 

No, no, no.

You stole this truck!

I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.

...fine.

 





...work!  It's not even load-...

Oh, shit.

Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...

You wanna hit me?

...I believe in live and...

Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.

Oh, shit.

Come on, old...

...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!

Fuck! 

Oh, shit.

Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!

That's right.  Now,  move!



Come on, old Pete.

I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.

...easy, easy, easy.

...wanna give it a try!

I made it!

What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!

...ho!





Yeah, he's a dangerous...

You're--?  What?!

...here!







This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.

Okay.

See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...

Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...

Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...

...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...

Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.

You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.

Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.

Not completely, anyway.

 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...

Listen, Arlo.

Hey, hey, hey.



Arlo!  Arlo.

Okay. 

Go!

Oh, fuck!

Here...

Come on.  Come on.

What?



Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 Yeah.

...face" crap you've been telling me?

You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.

 you see, that was a-that was my mission.

Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...

I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...

 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.

Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.

...without compunction.

But...

 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.

...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.



They were all wearing hardware.

Yes, sir.

Doc-...

Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?

If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.

Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!

...about--

...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.

...and the government.

...always done, Richard?

And let me guess.  You failed.

...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...

Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...

Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.

 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.



 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.

Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...

...comes up that road.

You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?





This was supposed to be a...

Dennis!

I wanna patch in from...

Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?

Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--

...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...

Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...

We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.

Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.

Doc...

...should be right outside.

And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.

Hello.

Yeah, I'm listenin'.





 

No.



Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?

...-time,  remember?

...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.

 Two pots of coffee...

Oh, no?

Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?

It's not over, Brynner.

Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.

I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.

...-time. 

...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.

...like a fish.

How can we ever hope to win against the trout?

Call an ambulance.

Cold?  Cold.  How cold?

And what if it does?

You're the only one I can trust.

...you, Mason?

What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!

There's a vent shaft leading straight up.

If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.

So you don't remember...

...beer.

I said let me see your hands now!

...stole a truck under arrest.

...tunnel now!

Okay, doc.

Get in 

Gimme this god-...

I'll stay here and secure this position.

Look at that.

Well, then, how about a ruler?

Sir?

Always?

They're calling it an accident.

Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.

None.

Why is that funny?

...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?

No.

Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.

...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.

How much are you worth?

Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?

Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?

She's just no good.

What's that, Curly?

Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.

Sure thing.

In the garage.

How much do you owe me, Curly?

I'll throw that in too.

So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.

Congratulations.

No. It was an accident.

It's too late.

If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.

That's it?

You never learn, do you, Gittes?

Give you three minutes.

Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.

Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.

But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.

Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?

I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.

I should talk this over with your husband.

May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?

No. I went riding rather early.

No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.

I got your check in the mall.

Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.

Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.

Mr. Gittes.

K... Cross.

You must've had a reason to ask me that.

Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?

Another satisfied client?

Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.

Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?

Never forgave him for what?

You sure shout that?

That dam is a con job.

The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.

In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.

What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.

Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?

It was in Chinatown.

Working for the District Attorney.

What's wrong?

I know.

You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.

Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.

Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.

I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.

Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.

Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.

Going somewhere?

J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar

Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.

There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.

I said the truth!

I said I want the truth.

How do you know?

Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.

Sophie.

Where'd he go yesterday?

Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.

There's just one question.

That's exactly what we wanted to hear.

You're a married man, am I right?

Have we ever met?

The water.

When it comes.

I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.

Gittes.

Gee whiz.  And I'm late.

Julian Cross worked for the water department?

He owned the entire water supply for the city?

How did they get it away from him?

They were partners.

Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.

Neither do I.

'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.

Alfredo, did you know my father?

I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going. 

Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 

What is it, what is it? What's the picture?

Did you ever see her again? 

Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 

What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!

But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!

But...who...

But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... 

I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?

Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.

The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.

How long's it been shut?

Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -

That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?

I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!

It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.

Let's hope they like it there.

Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.

Who else did you see?

You don't say!  Why I had no idea -

Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?

If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.

Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.

What's happened?

Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?

Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!

I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.

I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -

Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.

But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -

And the notice?

I'm sure that's it. 

Almost two to one -

Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -

I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -

Oh yes, there is.

Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -

What's funny now?

Where's the towel?

Thanks.

Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -

You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 

Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?

How old did you say you were?

Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.

Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?

It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.

I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -

Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!

I'm going to leave you.

Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -

I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.

I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.

Impossible!  Impossible!

But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -

Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?

"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.

How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?

Poor Mr. Carter!

That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -

It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -

Why not?

Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?

There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.

I'd like to talk to you about that.

First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."

Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.

Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -

You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.

Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?

You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie -  Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!

You still want to be transferred to the other paper?

I'll sign those papers -

You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -

Sorry, Mr. Leland.

Brief marriage!  Ten years! 

I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -

I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.

I know, but -

Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...

Yes and no.

What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?

The banks are out of luck, eh?

She's plastered, isn't she?

I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?

Excuse me, but...

Fifty-five.

Maybe you should take that coffee outside.

You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.

That's it, everybody out.

Yeah, but not in here.

She said not to come home until graduation.

So where is he?

God, isn't he great?

When did you get back?

I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.

Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.

Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.

Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?

You don't have anything to do with it.

You're serious. You want to date again.

It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.

You mean, on a date?

Sang.

I can already tell this isn't going to work.

Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.

And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!

I'm serious.

Stop this. This isn't funny.

There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!

What about Caitlin?

This is the last time I come to this place.

What the fuck is this?! I want some service!

I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!

Well, he missed!

Excuse me, do you have...

I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.

You're late.

The boss called. Arthur fell ill.

Seven months.

Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?

All four?

Empire.

Yeah.

You know what else I noticed in Jedi?

She's in here?

Perfect dozen.

The quest isn't going well?

What did he say?

It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.

Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.

What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.

It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.

Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.

He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?

I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.

Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 

I haven't seen her in almost two years.

She meant nothing to you!

You were saying?

An embolism in a pool.

Broke his neck.

I could never reach.

I can't fucking believe you!!

What's that for?

That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.

You're a danger to both the dead and the living.

You're kidding.

I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?

Hey, what about Veronica?

This life?

That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?

You should shit or get off the pot.

All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.

You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.

Am I right or what?

Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.

I thought I was doing you a favor.

How do you figure?

Like ten after.

It's not like I'm miles away.

I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.

No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.

I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.

Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.

I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.

What? When? When did all this shit happen?

Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!

Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.

At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.

Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?

That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.

Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?

You used to go out with her?

You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.

And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?

Actually, it is kind of rough.

I said go ahead.

Here. Now leave me alone.

At least they weren't lit.

Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...

Don't you have a hockey game at two?

Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?

Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?

What? What is that?

I was kidding.

You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?

You were making a generalization about "broads!"

Why'd you hit me?

All right. Name it.

Where?

What do you mean?

Sylvan can be talked into anything.

You sucked that guy's dick?

Well...?

It was only a few times...

Would you let me explain...

You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!

Excuse me, but have you been here all day?

A fine, for five hundred dollars.

I didn't do that!

I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!

Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.

Check this out, he's from Russia.

It's probably from being around all this food every day.

To an Asian design major.

I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.

And... he told you all of this?

I'm not sad.

After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!

I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.

No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 

I will. Take it easy.

Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.

"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?

Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.

Hal's signalling he's OK.

Jessie, Jessie, copy?

Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.

Glad you could drop in.

I love you, too.

Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--

She's losing it!

Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--

You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.

What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.

Take the gun.

She's tough.

Can I count as fast as I like?

Four...five...

He knows it well.

You can stop right there.

And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever.

The winds are picking up.

I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?

Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.

I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?

Resuscitation?

Which could maybe what?

Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?

You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.

That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.

I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--

Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.

It was great.

Gabe...your arm?

Gabe!  Are you alright?

Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.

Just kidding.

What about you?!

The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.

Murdering, motherfucker...

He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?

You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.

Travers!  Hurry it up.

I don't trust him.

This way.

I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.

Appreciate it.

Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.

What did you do that for?

One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.

Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.

Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.

Great, sir. Great.

Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.

I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!

My wife... Alex freezes.

Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.

You've not been to school all week, son.

Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.

Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?

Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.

A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.

When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?

Do you feel that way now?

Do you still feel suicidal?

Thank you very much for this chance, sir.

Good.

What job and how much?

As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.

What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.

Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.

You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?

Yes, sir.

Yes sir.

Do you mean Church of England?

Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.

Just part of hospital routine.

Isn't the plumage beautiful?

Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.

And when do I get out of here then?

Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.

What's all this about sin?

Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.

Father, I have tried, have I not?

These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?

But it is being used, isn't it, Father?

I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.

Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.

One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.

Carry on, Chief.

Moloko-plus.

How many to a cell?

Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.

Shall we go to my office?

Go ahead, say it.

Let me guess.  Clarinet?

Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.

You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?

Like what?

You like being a lawyer?

Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...

Not quite.  He did defense.  I'm a prosecutor...

Max, the cab driver!

You dizzy?  You want to sit down?

I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.

Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...

Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?

Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?

I'm sure you're very proud of Max.

I'm in town for a short time.

You're kidding me.

I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!

You hassling my driver again?

He'll keep calling.

Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.

Yeah?

Hello?

Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?

Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?

Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...

No.  You say you're cool.

You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.

You listening to me?

What are you doing?

You said you were visiting friends!

I didn't throw him, he fell.

Another collateral.

Jazz.  Music.

Let him go, Vincent.

Let's go.

What you mean, no?

Don't even think you're walking away from me.

Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.

Show up for what?

Mom, Vincent's not interested.

Limos, huh?

What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.

What, no insurance?

The man who hired me for this contract.

No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.

Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.

I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?

It's what I do for a living.

Well.  That was brilliant.

Max?

Testing some top secret seismic weapon.

Not for years.

The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.

You think I'm crazy.

I bit the bastard's nose off.

I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.

What took so long?  You were in there all day.

See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?

How long have we known each other, Jerry?

So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?

You want something to drink?

If my universe had a hub...

You're a Holden Caulfield fan.

You gave me an hour; now give me a day.

Shoot.

He's why you punish yourself.

Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.

You haven't been bothering them, have you?

Cold War's over, Jerry.

And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.

Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.

You will?

I don't know what to say.  I love you.

I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.

Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...

What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.

Is that what they told you?

Love at first sight?

Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?

<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?

You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.

Liza?

Geronimo is down.

You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.

You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.

Liza Sutton is dead.

I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?

So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?

Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.

Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?

That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.

Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?

Where'd you get it?

Hmm, how about tomorrow night?

Liza, settle a bet for us.

We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.

That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.

Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?

He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.

You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?

I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.

And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --

Peter sends his regards.

No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.

Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.

What is it?  What's happened?

I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.

You...

They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.

Because you cut it from the budget three years running.

Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.

What's the status of the decryption effort?

Dr. Lunacharsky...?

How can that be?

It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.

I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...

I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.

Please answer the question, Doctor.

So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.

Small moves, Captain, small moves.

Could we hear to China?

So who -- what -- are you?

Can you show me?

The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?

Am I one... or many?

So.  What happens now?

No!  I mean... why so soon?

Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.

No more stalling, Captain.

It's time to go home now.

You live here.

Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...

A machine.  But a machine that does what?

Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.

The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.

As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --

... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.

It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.

The V.L.A.?

Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.

Ellie.

It's good to see you, Ellie.

I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.

Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.

It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.

If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.

I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.

Ellie --

... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?

How do you mean?

What...?

Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.

I'm assuming you read my deposition.

So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?

I don't have any proof, Palmer.

It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.

It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.

You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.

Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.

Buck is a deal.

How'd you find me?

Yeah.

What went wrong?

Lookit her bounce.

Comin' out here, Boss?

You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...

Please! Please!

Here's the Patrol.

I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.

You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.

Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.

She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.

Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?

I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'!

He ain't eating beans fer lunch.

Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...

Lemme see it!

Whatta you so happy about?

Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.

I'm gonna kill you, you go on...

Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.

Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?

Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.

Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.

Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...

Do we even get our same bunks back?

You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?

A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.

Back a buck.

But -- but --

One, two, three... 

He'll never make it.

I hate this...

I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."

Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...

None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.

You're fired.

Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.

She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?

He was lying.

He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.

Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.

She's supposed to have it.

I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.

I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.

Who is this?

Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.

<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.

Is it an ongoing case?

That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?

We've got another one.

Ruben.

Is that it?

That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots...

Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?

You're afraid of him.

They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!

'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.

The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...

Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.

You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.

That computer's wired into INTERNET.

The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?

Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!

The lock...

It's a woman shot in a car?

He was in my apartment!

We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...

Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.

If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?

I heard. Good police work.

My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.

You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.

Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.

She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.

There was no sperm.

How about I put Nikko on it?

I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.

Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?

Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.

Where you going?

What the hell you need her for?

M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.

Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?

The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...

You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...

Where were you?

Not a lot of action here.

It's about time.

How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.

I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.

So - why the airport?

Can you drive?

Crash victim?

It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.

Patient.

I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.

What?

So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.

She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.

Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.

Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?

What do you think of this one?

What about this one?

Really?

Hi, Mom.

I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.

What do you think?

You did the right thing.

Will you get time off to do that?

Are you sure, Dear?

Oh no.

I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.

Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.

You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.

Chair, cup and ball.

What are you looking to read?

For a price.

No.

I'm not allowed to see you anymore.

Shocking, huh?

I wish I could have seen that.

What else would you do?

Tell me all.

First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?

I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.

Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?

Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.

What are we going to do?

I guess I should go now.

So, another one bites the dust.

Yeah?

I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.

Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?

Maybe you ought to see a doctor.

No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.

Yeah.

Especially now.

You what?

Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.

Who?

What?

I need someone to work on budget projections.

Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.

Agent Hadley.

What are you doing?

You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.

I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.

Too many people know about my involvement in this.

They left about a half hour ago.

Hey man, you can't do that!

Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.

Oui.

I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.

This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.

A million! I don't have that kind of money.

Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?

You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.

Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.

You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.

They're gonna be what?

Someone else coming?

Uh, no --

What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?

I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.

I don't know.

You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!

Because you're the closest.

In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.

He said to go fuck yourself.

Turn on the flashlight.

I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.

That moron.

Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?

We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.

What?

Does it really matter what I say?

Guns.   Can you get them?

Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--

Maybe you should call the police.

Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?

What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?

Hey boss, it's not a science.

Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.

The map said to go left.

What do we do?

Yes.

I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --

No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.

I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?

This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?

Today's your lucky day, Sami.

-- I want to be Elvis.

Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?

"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."

How's my brother?

Mr. Zammito?

Yeah.

How are we going to do that?

How do we know what room she's in?

I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.

I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.

You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?

Casandra. Old girlfriend?

You got it in a bar?

Can't sleep?

Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!

So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?

Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.

For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?

I don't care about your sword.

I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.

Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?

Go ahead.

You're already a thief.

In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.

You don't seem to understand.

Please sit.

Do you know her?

I'll socialize with whomever I please.

It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.

This spells trouble.

No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.

I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.

They forced me to marry!

Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.

You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!

Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!

Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.

Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.

Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.

We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.

Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.

Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.

You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.

You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.

Please, Sir Te, what is it?

Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?

But the sword could be in his compound.

Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.

No onions though, okay?

Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.

They couldn't do anything for me.

Mom --?

It's just the dope, don't worry

Do you feel okay.

You gotta go now, I bet.

You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.

Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...

I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.

You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?

Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!

I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.

You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.

How the hell did you do that?

What the hell are you?

...necklace... pearls...

What... the hell is that?

Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.

I've got him if you want him.

Are you okay?

Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.

You heard me.

His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.

Nothing.

No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?

So what year are you going into?

You a lesbo?

Oh really?

Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.

You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.

This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.

Shut up.

And that's a bad thing?

Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.

I can't. I'm seeing a friend.

That's also none of your business.

And you promise to abide by it?

Okay?

Alone again.  What are you up to today?

It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?

It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.

It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.

It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.

Ben Schwarz.

German.

Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.

That's great.

Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.

I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.

Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.

Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.

Does your mother know?

Why didn't you do something?

Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.

What are you doing?

Am I suppose to be this sore?

Good luck, Sebastian.

Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.

Whoa!

Yes.

McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.

One.

What do you do? Tell her you love her.

Yeah?

Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?

What's wrong?

Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.

Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.

Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.

Why not?

B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.

I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.

Fuck her yet?

Call me later.

The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.

I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.

Moving along quite well.

Any day now.

Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.

That her?

Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.

Why so nervous?

Well done.

Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.

Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.

I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.

I got your message and came as quick as I could.

Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?

Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.

First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.

Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -

Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -

Uh huh. You beat me three times.

I said, do you want some water?

Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.

Where the hell do you come off hitting women?

Kathryn. Did you hit her?

Did you hit her?

Ronald, I'm sorry.

Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.

I love the smell of pine.

Mommy --

Did you ever make a wish?

Well  the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.

No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.

Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?

My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?

Hello, Amy.

I got lots of presents.

Certain wishes do.

What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?

Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.

Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.

What'd you get for Christmas?

Irena. But who are you?

There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.

Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.

You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.

It got hit.

I hate the storm. I hate it!

But I am Barbara. I didn't die.

And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!

...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking

What is it, ma'am?

It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.

I didn't even have to coax her tonight.

But we have. She's wanted for nothing.

It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.

No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.

You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.

Yul Brynner. They're all dead.

Wow your body's really hot.

I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?

There was a sale.

How's the rest of your health?

He hasn't said one word to me.

My date always pays more attention to you than to me.

How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.

Or if there's a full moon.

Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.

I think she broke the skin.

You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.

I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?

I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.

He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.

Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?

What the hell is the tampon test?

I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.

Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.

Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.

Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.

Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?

I've been here. What day is it?

Holy shit, I don't know.

What happened to his tooth?

I think I just got my period.

The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.

What choice do we have?

No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.

About Benito.

Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.

I know.

Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.

You should have gone at the restaurant.

My apartment's just such a mess.

Uh huh. So pee.

Look what you did!

Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...

I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.

Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.

It's stupid.

A lot of people don't wear underwear.

Was there anything in that washer?

Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.

You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.

What's with the squirt guns?

Hello?

Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.

If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.

No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.

Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.

Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.

Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...

I need something to keep me awake.

Thanks.  Just some pills.

His wife.

Really?  And how is his state of mind?

What is this place?

Was that for real down there?

Why do you want to speak to him?

Itís extremely important to my investigation...

It seems fine.

How can I submit this?

Why give yourself up?

I don't know who they are.

Go on.

What now?

Look!  This is a good one!

I see.  The verdict, yes...

Donít kill me!

You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?

What does she say?  The woman.

Your name is John White.

What is it?

You understand what you'll be doing?

Uh --Mr. Alexander?

For a month.

Dave...

.. Nothing.

Choices???

Where's the girl?

Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.

A condition...

I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.

Check his kids.

Alan, we still have to control this guy...

I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.

Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?

Are you threatening me?

Uh-oh...

Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...

What happened?

You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...

I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.

Fine.

President vetoes works bill?

This is wrong, Alan!

Alan...

`Dave'?

Yes, but I wouldn't...

They re not my attack dogs.

Oh... Hi.

... Sometimes they do.

Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...

Really?

So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?

You got a gun?

What's that?

Didn't mean to bum you out.

You sure you don't want a lift back home?

You bet.

Where's home?

How were you gonna get home?

You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.

He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.

Are you hungry?

What's wrong?

Hi.

The Monroe?

What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?

It can't be. Are we truly in hell?

Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.

Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.

There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....

Thanks. I can fight my own battles.

Curse?

Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.

What?

Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.

This stuff really works? No shit?

But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!

If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.

Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...

It's because of me.

Step up here, Tyler.

So what the hell's Mutt been up to?

Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.

They're townies?!

Why doesn't he let you do what you want?

How was dinner?

So?

Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?

Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?

Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!

Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.

Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?

It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?

You know what really excites me about you?

Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.

No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.

Don't stop.

Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?

Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.

Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying

Charlie...

What are you going to do? - Charlie?

Pleased to meet you.

So, uh, where are you in school?

Hello?

If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?

If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.

Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?

Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-

I have to go home. Chet might call.

Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?

Again!  Louder!

LOUDER!

Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.

Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-

Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?

You really think I should forget her?

Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!

Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.

Where are you going?

His grades are hurting, Charlie.

But father, I'm assistant editor.

When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.

Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!

Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.

Weird.

I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.

My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.

So what do you think of my father?

Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?

Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.

By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?

From you?

Oh..

Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!

Chicken shit.  Where were we?

Put more into it!

Visit from my father.

You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?

Right here...middle of nowhere...

Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.

Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...

Not an option.

Who gives a shit about aft?

Now look what you did!

Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...

Yeah you did...

Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.

The "come back" kind.

What's the matter?

What is it?

I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...

Hanover!! Hanover!!

Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.

I think he knows that Joey.

Joey...it's okay...

Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?

You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...

She's gone...

All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?

You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?

What the hell does that mean?

Check it out!

Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?

She fucked you?

You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.

I'll get the boots.

Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!

Ammo! Get the ammo!

I thought that was it.

Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?

Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!

Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!

You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.

That's new, isn't it?

You're back.

See, I'm going home.

I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.

That's right. That's exactly what I mean!

You mean...?

Get anything?

Hey, guys...

Vince. Hey, you guys --

Hey, Nick...

Rough, huh?

Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?

Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.

How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?

Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?

That way it sets.

I just wait. You know?

You do?

What are you, hoping?

Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!

I like it, Nick.

I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!

Don't worry what it says in the book.

Oh. You know. How's it with you?

Where?

Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!

What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!

Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.

Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.

That's him.  Simon Doucet.

Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.

Funny guy.

I'm not on the force anymore.

I want to see my wife and kid.

What is it?  I'm about to go on.

You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.

Sir, your transmission's fading.

You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.

What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!

Sir, your limo's here.

Need help?

You sure?  I can help you.

Nobody's looking.

You my partner?

See those guys?

Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.

Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?

NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.

Married?

Yeah.

Good night, Wade.

Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.

I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.

Wanna try?

You okay?

I just heard.

You all right?

Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.

I'll take it.

The people, Jabez -- the people.

Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.

What are those people doing there? What do they want?

Who are these people?

Jabez -- ?

That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?

You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.

And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?

Make them go faster, Mr.... ?

Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!

What's that, sir?

But I like the new one better.

Say ... about the interest ...

Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.

Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?

You're not -- Dorothy.

She couldn't be gone!

Stevens!

Mornin', Jabez ...

What's the matter with you?

No, no! Give it to me!

Good evening, Neighbor Stone.

Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?

.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.

Are they all as -- small -- as that?

I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...

Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?

Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?

I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.

Why -- good morning, Squire.

Why of course --

" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?

Your butter money?

Mary--

Worried!

But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --

Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.

Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 

Mary --

Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.

Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?

Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?

You must go now, Mary -- you must!

Jabez -- Jabez!

Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.

Well ... make him keep quiet.

Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?

I want you to fix these fish!

My son ... what's the matter?

Hello, Sheriff.

What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?

She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!

Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!

What's that?

No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.

You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.

Say, that's pretty good, young man.

Me?

There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.

Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?

Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --

No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...

Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?

If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?

Meanwhile, you still live in New York?

Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.

Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.

So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?

What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?

I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.

-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --

John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?

Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...

Hope I'm not interrupting...?

Nothing...

No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.

Hans, he killed by brother --

He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.

-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --

The code key, please...?

Bad for your health anyway.

How long?

Go on.

They would, huh?

...I've missed you.						*

This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...

John!

Yeah.  How'd you know?

I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.

I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.

'Roy'.

No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.

You sound like a man with a couple of kids.

The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.

Roy?  You still with us?

They way you drive, I can see why.

Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.

Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.

I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.

What's going on?

What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?

This is --

They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.

Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.

No.  Look, we're kind of....

Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.

What are you talking about?

All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.

I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!

Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.

I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!

What am I supposed to do?

Would you do something for me? Please?

I can't survive in prison, Sonny...

Yeah.

No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.

Yeah... yeah!

Well... I don't know if I have or not.

You alone, or you got confederates?

Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?

Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?

Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.

Sonny-boy, one word?

Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?

I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?

Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.

What?

He wanted to kill me!

Sonny, be reasonable!

Okay, what do you give me?

You tryin' to fuck me?

So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?

You're full of shit ...

Well, what were you doin' back there?

Don't fuck with me ...

Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...

Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...

Yeah?

Is he all right?  Is he all right?

He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.

This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!

Howard, give him the keys...

Where's the back door?

Now, you -- what's your name?

You got kids?

Are we going to get the ball rolling?

I'm okay ... I'm okay ...

Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.

No you don't.

It's up to you ladies.

I didn't eat any pizza.

Did you always call him Junior.

No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!

He's gone?

It's the cops.  Shit!

Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.



You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.

I never been up in a plane before.

Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?

Bullshit!

I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.

Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.

Hey, you okay?

We can't stay here.

Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.

Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.

I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!

Robbing a bank.

What about, ah, non-union occupations?

I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...

<i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>

<i>They can do subtitles.</i>

Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?

Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.

Jesus Christ! What's that smell?

Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.

Okay.

Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.

<i>Did you get all four?</i>

Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.

I don't know.

Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?

Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?

<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>

Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.

Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?

LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!

Everything. It is a ghastly existence.

<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.

Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!

What the fuck is your problem? Bitch!! <b> INT. SOPHIE TROMAS MANSION -- KITCHEN -- DAY </b> Domino is loading her GUN at the kitchen table as Sophie serves breakfast. Domino wolfs it down.

Cool it, Choco.

What did he say about the arm?

Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.

We're late.

They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?

Where is Domino?

You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.

Talk to me.

Ya back is got.

Yo!

So?

Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.

Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.

You the man.

No, you the man.

It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.

As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.

The evil eye doesn't work on me.

You're a drunk fool.

Sal's gonna be mad.

I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.

Hurry up and get dressed.

Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.

Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.

It's a fucking shame.

Sweet Dick Willie.

Let it be broke.

It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.

Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?

ML stands for ML.  That's it.

Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run.

Mookie, get offa da phone.

Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?

Sal, can you do me a favor?

Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.

Yeah, do you know 'em?

Whatdafuck do you want?

Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.

Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.

Tina, you are too slick.

No!  No!  You won't come back either.

Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?

Later for you.

What?

Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.

Just coolin'.

Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--

Who's your favorite basketball player?

And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?

Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?

I'll do that.

Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.

I'm listening.

I love you, my brother.

Get the broom.

Me and you are gonna have a talk.

Some are OK.

I know this.

Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.

Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.

Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.

Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.

Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.

Then we could try something else.

I didn't think so.

Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.

You're it.

I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?

Hi.

Hey guys.

Excuse me?

Would you like something to drink?

I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.

Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.

Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?

Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!

No, it's a treasure map.

What?

Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?

You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.

You know, you're the first person I've brought here.

H A R R Y...

Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.

Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.

Yeah, go-cart accident.

I will stop this car right now.

Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?

...cause you said...

Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.

Who cares? Chicks are for fags.

It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.

Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?

Do you want me to pet your head?

Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.

HARRY! I found the treasure!

HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?

If you have to ask, you don't know.

You're it.

Hey, it's Jessica.

Cute puppy.

Well, I'm listening now.

But my mom gave me the map.

That's what Jessica was talking about!

HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!

Hey there goes Principal Collins!

You take her.

I thought I told you to get lost.

You had some questions.

I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?

TURK, leave him alone.

Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!

HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.

Yes, what?

Well I was born in St. Louis.

HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.

So could you get us into the principal's office?

So, when can we do it?

What are you doing?

That's my boyfriend.

How much homework is there?

Sure.

Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?

Have you got what I want?

How was that?

LLOYD, may I see you a minute?

Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.

I think you did it.

I'm not sure if I can do this.

I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.

It's the big potato.

To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?

Knock knock.

Guess what"s under these coconuts.

It's a surprise.

You got the Extender?

The evidence of what?

Where is it?

It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.

I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?

My Lord!

The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.

He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.

Yes?

You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.

The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.

Yes, Sire.

Dust cloud ahead, Sire.

No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.

Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.

Things have been so serious here lately.

You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.

No, but many consider my training valuable.

Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.

Death may be the result....  Are you sure?

Always?

Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.

The Water of Life.

The Voice again.

Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?

Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.

Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?

I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!

Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??

Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!

But you're a big star!

Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.

Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.

Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!

Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --

No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.

Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...

Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?

Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.

Don't you have any savings?

So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?

Oh.  So what is the scene about?

Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!

I've never seen anything like him!

This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!

PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!

What do you think you're doin'?!

Edward Wood, Sir.

There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.

We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.

Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!

Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!

It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.

From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.

Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.

I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?

Goddamn landlord.

I'm going to my mother's.

That's right...

Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?

Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.

He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.

Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.

Yeah...?

Hmm, so you're in the picture business?

I think you're quite handsome.

So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.

No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.

What is happening?

I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!

And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!

Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!

They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...

Hello.

Stop!

The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?

No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?

I can't get it to go up.

But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!

You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --

You're <u>sure</u>???

You know, to make the legs move --

Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!

B-but it's our money --

What are you, an angora wholesaler?

Wow.

ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.

What if I'm vomiting?

I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --

No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.

Yeah. I brought you some movies.

They celebrated the common person.

It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.

Did you see that?

Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.

Uh-huh?

Yeah?

I don't think so.

With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!

According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --

Al!

No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!

Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him

So he killed himself.

No.

He had girlfriends!

Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.

Who?

I'm at the hospital.

One thing led to another. He was my husband once.

She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.

How much less?

Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.

Hey, Lou.

Ha!

Really?

I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!

Really?

You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.

It's really a tremendous turnoff.

I wish my stepfather was here.

I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.

So? What do they think -- we're not kids --

I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!

Where?

It's not their fault.

What's up?

You know, that would be like a great thing.

I got your message. Way to go!

You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?

She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.

Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?

Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal

You brought the girl!

Good-bye, brother!

You know what your problem is?

Check forging.

Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...

Oh!!

We don't have foibles.

Yo --

Tu

You did it at your house?  Your own house?

Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.

You gonna do it? You gonna do it?

Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up

Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -

Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.

Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.

Fuck me, Mr. McAllister

You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.

Yes?

What do you mean?

I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!

So what brings you here?

Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?

Plenty of pep, too.

So Tracy?

I want you to do something for me.

Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.

What a surprise.

You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?

Exactly when?

I don't believe you.

Could you get this? I can't

So what do you think?  Should we get a room?

Hey Yeah?

Three twenty-five.

Don't say that.  You know it's not true.

Where 're you going?

These are private -- these are for us.

Yeah.

Paul, will you sign my yearbook?

Can I sign yours too?

Now could you leave me alone?

Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.

You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.

That obvious, huh?

I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?

You say 'fuck' a lot.

I don't know.

In the morning.

Lad, may I have a word with you?

Captain, what do you want?

They're yours.  Take them.

Give me one minute.

Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.

No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.

Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.

Where are we going?

Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.

It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.

Ellis Loew.

She's fine.

I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?

Thanks, but no thanks.

I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.

Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.

Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?

What do you want to know?

Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.

What do you mean?

More or less.

I heard you like to shoot dogs.

Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?

Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?

Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.

And?

I... No.

No.

Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.

Yes, I do, sir.

Why?

No... Where'd the tip come from?

I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.

Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?

Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.

Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.

What's that for?

We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.

I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.

Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.

Really?  What did White say?

How about White?

Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?

I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.

No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.

Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.

Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.

Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.

That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.

Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.

They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.

You're back, boychick.

The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.

You tight with the D.A., trash?

What happened with the kid and Loew?

Have we met before?

Was it a party?

It'll be our secret.

Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.

What happened?

And you were the last one to talk to him.

What'd he say to you?

What'd he give to you?

Tell us about Rachel Banks.

Yes.

I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.

I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.

What'd I tell you?

They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.

That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.

You're driving.

Fuckin-A.

Drive.

Goddammit--

Same thing?

Feeling lucky?

Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--

--Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?

I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.

It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.

I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.

You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--

Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.

Than why can't you tell me.

Anything at all?

Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?

I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?

Hey.

So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?

You should take this seriously.

What?

I'm sorry.

Bobby?

Who did you work with to get the--

Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--

You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.

Stacy--

I know, but listen--

I know.

Is Eric in school?

I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.

...who root through...uh...presents, and...

Is it over?

Who?

I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.

Why the hell would I--

Actually, that's not true.

And then what?

I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.

Thank you.

I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.

It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.

I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.

What makes you think it's you?

He didn't <u>give</u> me--

I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!

Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.

Who would do that?

A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.

Robert--

In your dreams.

He's kidding.

Where've you been?

Who won the fight?

No.

No, but they took my blender.

The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--

My stuff's all over her apartment.

They're framing me.

I don't know!

No, I--

To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.

It's been a few years.

I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--

Are you okay?

No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?

What does that have to do with you?

What is it you want?

Well we'd sure like to help you.

"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.

30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?

Yes sir.

No sir.

And they have the video. That's confirmed.

If they've looked at the video.

Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.

Federal Express?

This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?

I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it

Which stall?

That insults them.

Will you please come in?

When were you least happy?

Say you're sick.

I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.

What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?

Dance with me.

It's so cold.

Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you.

Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?

All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -

Very well.

Good morning!

I see.

If I could just see some identification.

Right.  And what's your name, sir?

You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.

Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.

Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.

Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.

They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg inhave you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?

Yeah, for a while.

I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.

No.

I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.

Buon' giorno.

Have a drink.

Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -

I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.

There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.

And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?

You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.

Why do you think?  About my staying?

Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.

I do so love you.  What do you smell of?

Marvelous plane.  Did you look?

Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?

Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?

I liked it better when there were just the two of us.

Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?

Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -

I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.

Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.

This is hot!

I mean home.  India.

Why Picton?

Hello.

Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.

You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.

Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.

Darling, Peter says I could stay

Katharine!

You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?

How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.

What are you talking about?

They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!

Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.

A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.

You ordering chop suey again?

And the draft blew over the flowers.

That's doable.

How close?

I have a question...

Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.

You have a car?

You disappeared.

Do you mind?

Very nice.

I don't believe this.

Nothing? You don't even lock the door?

Nice spot.

Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?

We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?

I go in alone.

I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.

So you're testing <u>me</u> now?

You're nervous again.

Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.

Can you see the other PIRs?

Now's when you tell me who you really are.

If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.

Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?

The Mask. Where is it?

What about the rules?

It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.

Got it.

So how long till we do this?

You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.

Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.

Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?

Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.

So what are you going to do with your share?

And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...

Jesus.

I cannot get rid of you.

Put this on!

Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.

It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.

Always in a rush.

I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.

The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?

If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.

Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?

Right.

I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.

Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.

Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?

You'll just have to have faith.

My friend, you always surprise me.

... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --

Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.

Tony Marvin.

I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?

So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.

Hi.  Donna Irving?

I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...

So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.

You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.

Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.

No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.

The judge came up with a number.

... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.

Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?

Yeah?

All I have is hundreds.

How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.

Come on, I'm trying to help here.

Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?

I don't get why they'd do that.

And you can't?

Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.

Then I don't get anything either.

Bullshit.

We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.

This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.

Is that what I think it is?

See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --

I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.

I was just asking.  Are you all right?

I want my fucking money --

Is that what you want?

What kind of things come up?

Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?

How dare you take that away from me.

Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?

And if you had to guess ...

So why would PG&E offer it?

Wait, what do you mean, ten years?

I was wrong.

Ed, I swear, I'm not --

I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.

Nope.  And I didn't ask.

Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.

Ross.

You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.

Pattee?  That your middle name?

Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?

So that stuff -- it kills people.

Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?

County water board.  All righty, thanks.

Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?

Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.

You want my number?

Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.

No.

I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.

This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.

What're you doing?

You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?

George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?

I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.

I'm bored, and so are the kids.

More than you need me.

Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.

Dr. Paulsen?

Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.

Soon, Lord Vader.

He can do it.

He'll learn.

Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.

Barks a blue streak.

Barks at his master.

... the power?

Barks his consternation.

I'm looking for someone.

Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...

Because of my father, I guess.

The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.

That's right.

Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.

He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.

Sir, I was wondering ...

What are you so grouchy about?

It sounds like it's trying to get in.

We?

There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.

That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....

We've got to get out of this shower.

There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.

I do not!

Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.

I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.

Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.

I don't like this.

What are you staring at?

You look silly.

How's your mining operation going?

What about Leia and the Wookiee?

That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.

No.

We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.

That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--

I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.

Look, I stand to lose everything by this.

What?

No argument, just do it.  That's a command!

Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...

Where are you going?

Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?

Four this time!  The Force you feel.

What's in there?

Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?

Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.

All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.

Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.

In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.

Zira, are you mad?

What, Lewis?

But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.

Humans?

Primitive?

May I say something personal?

ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.

The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.

His reactor's starting to overheat.

You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.

Who's that?

I was called away on urgent business, Snake.

I don't know, sounds thin to me.

No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?

No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.

Shut up, Plissken.

That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.

Get this crap out of me.

I'll need to know more about this thing.

So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?

It's the President, for Christ's sake!

Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.

Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.

Where are they going?

Later.

How do you know all this?

Me too?

Aw, come on, Snake.

Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.

Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.

Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.

Snake - what is it?

Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?

Where's the anti-toxin...?

I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.

Yield. I have the advantage.

Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.

These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.

Perceval, you have returned!

He can be no other.

Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--

It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--

The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...

Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?

Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...

What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.

I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...

With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...

I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.

Who is, then?

It didn't hurt too much, did it?

But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...

Me?

The law forbids it.

You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?

A lovestruck page!

I showed you all my conjuring tricks...

What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.

I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.

I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.

What honey?

Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.

Hello?

Just five or six people.

What did the doctor say?

It's serious?

Rats?

But it's clean?

No. No rats.

Excuse me Miss?

A stimulant.

Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?

The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.

Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.

Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.

Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.

So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?

You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?

Did he tell you about my party?

On what?

I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?

You wouldn't.

If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?

To begin with it could make things worse.

Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...

There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.

She...killed Burke Dennings.

Yes. He's already here.

Is she gonna die?

You know how?

Who's Captain Howdy?

It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.

Well your thinking's not so good.

What are you doing here?

What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?

Goodbye Father. I call you.

I believe you.

Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.

Lieutenant?

You just missed them.

She seemed fine.

He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".

You'd like that?

Do it again.

No now.

How long are you planning to stay in Regan?

I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!

I'm all right.

Is that too tight?

Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?

Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.

And let my cry come unto thee.

What is it?

William F. Kinderman. Homicide.

Really?

Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.

Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.

Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?

Hey, Father? You like movies?

Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.

Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?

Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!

Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...

Miss?

Yes

So?

Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.

Maybe next time.

I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...

Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.

You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?

Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!

Twenty years, Ma ...

Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.

Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...

Jack.

Jack.

What's wrong with it?

Count it.

This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.

What d'ya got?,

Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?

This time you gotta go.

I made her nervous.

What's with Charlie?

What're you talking about?

The hell you don't.

Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.

What was it like?

A gust of wind killed him.

I'm not unhappy.

Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.

Get out of here.

Get out of here!

I just wish she'd get here, that's all.

Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.

You all right?

Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.

Day.  Wednesday.

Have some more wine, Frank.

Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.

How dare you say you love me.

He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.

The party's over.

Expensive hangover.

The Royal.

A useless talent.

They were simple songs.

I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?

Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.

What do you mean?

Be reasonable, Jack.

What channels it on?

We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?

Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.

You weren't there.

Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.

Looks like these got a few years on them.

You sure?

A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.

Your limo's ready, Ma.

So she's got a few sniffles.

Candy Man.'  Is that all right?

So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?

I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.

I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?

We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.

That!  You can't wear that!

Oh, thanks.

Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?

Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?

Great?

Hey, will you look at that?

Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!

That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.

I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?

Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.

Brought it.

Thanks.

Don't worry about it.

Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.

No.

Where's egghead?

No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.

Aren't the kids asleep?

Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.

It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.

Relax.  We'll drop the song.

I can keep the beat.

What's that supposed to mean?

You were good.

Nina?

Soap convention.

Oh. So what's it doing here?

Frank said ---

Jack.

Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.

My days are not the old days, genius.

Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?

How'd the show go?

How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?

Perfect fit.

Pollux ...

So?

What do you mean?

Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!

Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.

I'm late for surgery.

No.

Is someone there?

I took it from my fake husband.

I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?

Which ear was it?

You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.

-- Castor?

Stay away from my family!

Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.

What are you -- stupid?

You always call me Miss Brewster.

You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!

Commander, what are you doing here?

Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?

I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.

I'm just having some fun.

What's that?

What happened to your big "assignment"?

Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?

You're wearing your suit --

Nothing.

Where's Jamie?

I'll deal with her later.

Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.

You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?

Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...

You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.

Why Jack?

You have kids, Jack?

Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.

We did one point seven million in total revenue...

And I know people.

Take you, for instance...

...thats our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.

They did a pretty good job.

The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.

You know how to make chocolate milk?

You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?

I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.

Maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.

Trouble at work?

Damn...

Wheres your follow through?  Wheres your stance?

So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?

You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.

Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...

I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...

Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.

Its a glimpse, Jacko.

As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.

...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...

You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!

Evelyn, right?

Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...

I can't seem to let go of you...

Are you okay?

Jack...

Shes your dog, Jack.

Uh...that babys crying...

Shouldnt we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?

I mean...wow...off the charts great.

Our life in a nutshell...

Cmon.

Say it, Jack...

Maybe I should wait...

You really are incredible...

Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey...

Youre so...beautiful...

So whats the big surprise? You didnt rent this place for the weekend, did you?

This place is a perk, Kate.

Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.

Annie goes to a great school.

Dont do that...

Its been interesting, thats for sure.

I promise, Jack...

So youre not at a non- profit firm?

Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...

Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...

He certainly has your number, Alan.

Can I help you?

Damn...damn...damn...

No...Im not...

It's Christmas Eve, Jack.

I found it!

I mean...

Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.

I'm not really dressed for a party.

Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --

Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?

The shields on the station should protect us.

I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.

I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.

You got a chisel round here?

Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --

It's about to be a broken face.

Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.

What's wrong with me?

What do you want, Vic?

We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.

We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.

<u>Where is Reed</u>?

At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --

What?

Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.

He's not responsive --

Now what is up with <i>that</i>?

He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --

Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.

Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --

Johnny?  Did you see Ben?

I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --

Then what is it?

Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.

Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --

But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.

Funny how things turn out, isn't it?

Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.

Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?

<u>Ben</u> did this?

Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --

I, uh, think I remember the number.

Which was?

It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.

What?

Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...

I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --

Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.

Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --

Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...

What's going on?

Victor, I'm sorry I --

Victor, your scar --

If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.

Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --

Where do we stand?

Okay to proceed.

I know that. But what's the maximum?

<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.

Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.

I told you to cut down on the sugar.

Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --

They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.

Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!

Just one, General...

You're going out there? With those Antibodies --

Doctor...

Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.

Air bubbles!... Doctor --

That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...

That'll teach you where to keep your hand.

A long time, with one man.

You must carry spare parts --

If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?

Thank you for saving my life.

That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.

Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.

I've done all I could with the laser.

If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.

The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.

Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...

We'll never get there in time, at this rate.

How does it look, Doctor?

About forty miles an hour.

Tell them to take us out.

At this size, I would certainly think so.

All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.

Sabotage? I don't understand...

We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.

Looks like quite a way to go...

Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?

I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!

Atomic fuel?

That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.

All in all, quite a canoe...

'Prepare for Miniaturization'...

Any reserve air?

Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?

What is it, Skipper?

What's wrong, Skipper?

There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...

You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -

I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.

I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!

Can I see your license and registration please?

...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.

Where is Pancakes Hause?

One of us pays the other for half.

Huh?

Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.

Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -

What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?

Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -

...Blood has been shed.

We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!

We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!

Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.

He's three now. Course, not in that picture.

Yah, he -

Both of these.

Yah.

...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'

And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'

And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'

Just a general way.

Where you girls from?

Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.

I dunno. Just funny-looking.

I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.

Yah.

LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.

A subconscious-type thing.

You're not a C student.

You know what a disparity is?

Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.

The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.

Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?

...How ya doin' there, Scotty?

It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.

Dad, I really think we should call the cops.

Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -

Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -

Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -

but do you know that for sure without -

Well... yah.

Yah!

Yah.

Shep said 8:30.

Are you calling Stan?

Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?

Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -

No kiddin'?

Yah.

We're good to loan in.

You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?

What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.

- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!

Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!

Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!

No, see -

Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?

Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?

Well, that's okay, I just -

Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -

I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.

Ya see something down there, Chief?

How's it look, Marge?

You look in his citation book?

Yah, that's a good one.

Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?

Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.

...What can I get ya?

You're livin' in Edina, then?

...I was married to Linda Cooksey -

Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -

Nope.

Nope.

...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.

Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -

Linda Cooksey?

His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.

Gustafson's accountant.

Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?

Whose car?

Hon?

Yah.

You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?

Not on your feet too much?

You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?

Yah.

Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?

What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.

The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...

And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...

You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?

After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.

Is that your blood?

I must've left the original in the copy machine.

Hmm?

It means it was homemade.

I'm in pain.

Why are you doing this?

We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --

You're kidding.

So far, you have four and I only have two!

That's the idea -- we split them.

Look, this is a bad time...

I'm just on my way out...

What are you talking about?

This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?

Here.

Uh ... nah.

You... don't have to... leave.

When?

I don't know.

I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?

What is this?  Who did this?

What did you say... ?

Say my name.

... and you come home to this.

How have you been?

You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.

-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.

It's getting exciting now.

Thank you.

I guess so.

Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.

What list?

I don't... think so.

Well, I have to file a claim...

One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.

Go ahead.  Say it.

Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.

Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.

My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?

Alive or dead?

Okay... Ghandi.

Unbelievable, huh?

I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?

Huh?

What is this place?

As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.

This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.

There's fight club in Delaware City.

Hey.

Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?

Something on your mind?

What the hell ... ?!

I don't know!  Nothing!

You're too young.  Sorry.

You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.

The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.

He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!

You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...

...stop me?

You want out?

Ask me nicely.

Why... why... why... ?

I'm doing this for us.

If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...

What are you doing?

Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?

Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...

Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.

Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.

A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.

Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.

Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.

I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.

Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?

You've made your point.

What?

May we come in?

Tell me again how it started.

Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... 

You mean Alex Browning.

I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.

This is cheery.

Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.

Stop it, don't move him!

Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.

Shouldn't we pull over?

Are you okay?  You just face planted!

The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.

Kimberly?  It's Dad.

I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.

There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.

You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.

"It?"

That... him?

Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!

Remember the departure time?

You're payin' for my trip, Browning!

Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.

Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.

I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...

I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.

I'm sorry we broke in.

And don't pass on the right.

You mean the snake?

Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!

... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We probe the site...

That's what I'm here for.

Batteries not included.

You wanna know why I stood up for this show?

It's a guy in a cage.

It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.

Where did you find this clown?

Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.

Where's Nguyen now?  What city?

Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."

Yes you can.

Why me?

How long have you been setting up?

But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.

So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?

You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.

What's your name?

That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.

This your stuff?

What did you want?

Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.

Let's do it.

This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.

My parents were divorced.

What?

Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.

Then why the hell do we watch all the time?

I'm sorry.

... So... where did you sleep last night?

Lydia?!  Lydia who!?

See, I told you!

You're kidding!  What did he say?

What?

No.

I think.. I...I realized...I love you.

What if I was a relative?

Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?

Where you comin' from?!

Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?

Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?

You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.

People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...

Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.

... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?

How un-sixties of you.

Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.

Now what?

Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...

Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...

Where am I?

Hi... Where are my shoes?

Where -- ?

<u>What</u>?!

They said you're The One.

... Do you know who I am?

What's her name?

Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.

I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!

SAW WHO!!?

I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.

Maybe, when we get the Grail...

No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.

...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.

Beautiful night huh?

OWWW....What are you nuts?!

Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!

You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!

How do you know him?

Don't say that.

Well, it's enough for me.

So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.

... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.

If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.

I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.

I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...

Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.

You just going to sit there?

You like it?

Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?

You're depressed that I come along.

Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.

I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?

What's your name?

I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.

No substitutions.

Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.

She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.

No, I'm not...  I'm not.

Sorry.

Oh.

It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.

Yeah... I guess so...

Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...

I think he's got a terrific personality.

Where is she, anyway?

Swimming?

If you're free.

One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...

That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...

You had no inner feeling?

Catherine...

I don't find your language that charming.

No, don't do that...

Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.

Robert?

I have to talk to you.

I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.

No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...

Four or five years.

Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?

I'm not aware of it. Like what?

See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?

Come on, get moving, dammit!!

Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?

I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.

Oh, no. You're more than welcome.

I don't think that's true.

I don't know where you were, penis envy.

What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...

And what about love?

Mass production is what does it.

Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.

In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...

Yeah, it could be adorable...

And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...

John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...

The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...

If you want to call it that.

That's exactly what I am doing, again.

What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.

I told you, no. I'm not that type.

What are you doin' here?

A play-ya.

I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?

Wha'?

How does he look up close?

I think he's 18 or 17.

Who?

So what do you want with her anyway?

How do I know you're not lying.

Where you know Amanda from?

You live around here?

Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.

I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?

Maybe tonight?

I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.

Wonder who his supplier is.

I wasn't asking.

Creasy, how old are you?

What? What are you talking about?

You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.

You can't keep me here.

I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.

Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.

So where do you know Alan from?

That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.

Mrs. Smith.

Right.

Margaret.

I think Id rather have drugs.

Jesus.

Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.

Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.

You should have proved that in a court of law.

I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.

John Ultramalensky, right?

I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.

Sure you did.

Where does the Chief get the drugs?

I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.

I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.

I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.

So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.

Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.

Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.

It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.

Did you hear something?

W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.

'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'

'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'

His bride. Cute as a button.

Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?

I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.

Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.

Alan's in Utah.

What's he doing in Utah?

Hi.

'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'

Good point.

I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.

Who.

What's wrong, Gail?

And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.

I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.

They just left, sir.

The door was unlocked.

What did you want under the bed?

I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.

Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.

What's the spread on the game tonight?

So let's go! We run the pictures.

You'll have it.

Not really.

Who's Frieda?

Yes?

You don't know the Underhills?

I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?

Mrs. Stanwyk!

Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!

Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.

Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.

Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.

Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.

I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.

You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?

All your friends call you Jazz.

Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.

What did you... Hey, where's your spex?

She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...

Ah, an obvious choice.

I came to warn you...

What an interface!

Hey, they blew me.

It's red, Ford.

Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?

What?  Jesus, tell me!

Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?

I'm afraid so, you want her?

This way...

Suck a dick, I left my purse...

Ick.

This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.

Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.

What are you running from?

'Booty Time.'

God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.

Polo.

Off what?  Twenty seconds...

You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!

Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.

Shit.

You're that guy, the private eye.

I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.

What?

What about you?  Can you stand a toss?

I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.

B.O.C.A.

Who knows?

No... yeah...

Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.

Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.

Le sommes nous?

Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.

Are you sure it is dead?

Il est en retard.

We must follow it.

You're in show business.

All right, get up on that bar and dance.

There's nobody like that on six.

There may be two... no, three who could fit it.

Des Moines.

That's in France.

What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?

Christ you should o' collared him right there.

Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.

If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.

You got the warrant?

Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?

You want the red or the white?

My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.

Can you use a new suit for Christmans?

No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.

I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.

So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.

That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.

Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?

You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?

I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?

They around?

Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.

Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...

Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?

How was your tour?

Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.

I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.

Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.

Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!

Hey, bud.

No, I don't.

As nuts as that sounds, yes.

What if I could prove it to you, Satch?

What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.

In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.

Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.

I'm scared.

Daddy, Daddy, I can't.

What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.

Sorry 'bout that.

You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?

Dad...?

No wait, don't go!

Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...

What kinda twisted animal.

Whatta you mean...

I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.

So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?

No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.

Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.

I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.

He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?

Dad, what the hell is going on?

Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?

My father didn't die in a fire?

This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.

I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.

I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...

Wife around?

I look familiar?

Nah, just working the job.

No kiddin'?

Sullivan?

Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!

Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.

No more... I can't!

Why don't we go take a swim?

Hey Deb... can you hear me?

What are they saying?

Look what I found.  Remember these?

No.  I got here just before you did.

Goldilocks and the Three Bears?

This is too painful to look at.

What do you mean?

Why did you come back here?

I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?

When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...

Please... be cool.

See anything?

Got any good ideas?

Why do you do these stupid things?!

If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.

Darren, we better turn around.

I'm getting real tired of this maniac.

Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!

Ahh, nothing.

You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.

Never should've let her play.

Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.

How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?

...And I said, shut up!

Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.

No.  No, it's not...

Why?

Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?

Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.

You mean you had a bad dream.

...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?

It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.

So where's Cort gone off to?

Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.

Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.

I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.

You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...

Eight times.

I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.

I'm kind of busy right now...

Look --

Ed...

Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.

Where the fuck is she, Duke?!

Tell me.

Tell me!

She's beautiful.

Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?

Wanna know how I did that?

I know what it sounds like.

She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.

-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!

I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.

I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.

No thanks.

It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.

Did you hear that?

Where's the radio?

I demand to know what is going on...

Did you find Rennie?

I doubt very much that one even exists.

You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.

Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.

If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...

Everything okay?

I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.

When did this start?

Yes...

Rennie...what'd they do to you??

Crosstown.

We must abandon.

Under the Manhattan Bridge.

We must abandon.

I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.

Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.

Tonight. What's tonight?

What happened eighteen months ago?

Is it safe?

I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.

I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.

Shoot him.

Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?

How do you Eknow.

What do you mean?

This could be it.

This could Pbe it.

This could be it.

Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.

That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.

I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.

We're able to surprise each other.

Do you want to get some coffee?

Is it?

Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.

You have to tell me what you thought of the play.

What else?

What else?

Am I really so deeply repugnant?

Your father said you might be here.

I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.

Opening night, Lillian.

You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.

We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.

Life is good.

People are dependable.

It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.

Who is it?

Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'

Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.

Let's not start that again.

You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.

I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.

You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.

A grandmother. God bless you.

It's the kid's lucky day.

You're a family man, Frankie?

Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.

All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.

This could be it!

Then they lost?

aybe we ought to postpone the opening.

I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.

I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.

Yessiree, Bob.

Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

So does Elliot.

Endearing.

So do I. Over and over.

I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.

Home.

In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.

Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.

Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.

"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.

God gave you ten thumbs.

"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?

But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?

What do you expect when you talk like that?

Just an admirer...

And Jinnah?

You're an ambitious man.

And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?

You've done me a great service.

After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.

It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.

We need your help!

They're sparing no one, I see.

I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?

You're an extraordinary man.

Assuming we are in agreement?

All right. Fine.

Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?

Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.

How much extra?

No?  What's keeping you?

--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?

He's not here.  It's a blind alley.

From what budget?

We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?

It's about the Director.

Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.

You okay, Jerome?

God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?

I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!

They'll recognize me.

If you say so.  The stripe.

Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.

Where are you taking her?

How are you, Jerome?

Why have you done this?

Where are you going?

What will happen to the others?

Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.

So we don't know for sure about you, either.

Why don't we say we were together?

Have they found our friend?

You didn't know?

I envy you, Jerome.

It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.

Of course I think about it every day.

So you didn't do it after all.

Why are we leaving?

What about the car?

If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.

I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.

Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...

You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.

A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.

We'll try again.

You okay?

Feel good?

It doesn't look like that.

Half a million.

You been okay?

How's Estelle?

That's not all of it.

I guess I'm kind of...

How was it?

I was going to fix you breakfast.

Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.

That doesn't hurt.

I didn't. I just waited.

... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...

You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.

We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.

Why didn't you tell me?

Do you mean that?

You're full of ifs.

Only one car.

How much?

No scars?

We got this far.

Sounds good.

Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.

I don't know.

You okay?

Are we going to make it?

What now?

You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?

STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.

Gonna knock down a wall?

Yeah. I got out.

Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...

Where we go in1?

I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?

Don't you want to go to the airport?

You're going to have to walk back to the border.

Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?

Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.

No choice. I had a visit from somebody.

How'd it happen, then?

You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!

Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.

You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.

What about?

I want to talk to you later.

Nothing more? Just another feller?

I call that regular.

Yes, while he was here.

He must have been pretty sure I'd come.

And what was that?

What does he want that bloody great country place for?

Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?

How's school?

Oh, what you doing now?

Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.

I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.

I mean, what for?

Where would I find him?

See you later.

Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?

Did they give you a rough time?

I won't be using the room tonight.

I'm staying with a friend.

Will this do?

Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.

What is it?

What the bloody hell do you think you're at?

Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?

Now just a minute...

'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.

Are you awake?

Meaning what?

So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.

Jack! I didn't like that.

You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.

Not suede boots!

Polacks and deadbeats.

You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.

You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"

It's too...

He's doing very well.

That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.

Starting up.

Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?

You...

You build it!

I want to tell you what somebody should do.

Someone should stand up and strike back.

Somebody...

Should do something to them.

Did I say that?

Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?

Are you sure?

...you don't have to come in...

That's ridiculous.

Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?

Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?

Why?

What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...

I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...

Clear...

Everything I...you know...

I am?

A waste of time?  Why?

The cops?

Yeah.  You know who doesn't?

Thieves.

Will you excuse us please?

Did they catch...?

...how can you talk to me that... that...

What?

...that's why I came in.  I thought I...

Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...

I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...

Mmm.

Excuse me, fella.

Who told you...?

Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.

Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.

Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...

You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?

Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...

John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...

Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.

The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...

I'm out.

Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?

I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...

No.

Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...

Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.

Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!

Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...

Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?

No.  It hadn't.

Five thousand.  I kept half.

Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!

I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.

Don't.

Those fuckin' deadbeats...

Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...

...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?

Dave...

Just now.

...yes...

I wanted to speak with you about...

I'm sorry...?

...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?

Yes.

I've got to talk to you.

Who did she call?

Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...

Three business days.  They mean three business days.

What's going on here?

No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.

Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.

Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...

You just this morning...

It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.

Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.

What is this, your farewell speech?

They got, listen to me...

They took some of the con...

Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...

...I wouldn't worry about it.

Are you alright?

Did you like your party?

Did you see my present for you?

Will you take me?

Why do you have to go?

Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.

I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.

Your friend lives in a fine building.

Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.

Bought at the airport.

How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.

The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.

Goddamn bitch.

Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.

You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.

I understand...

Ready, Frankie.

Hey Mike, what can I say?

No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.

That's what I'm here for.

How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?

Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.

The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.

Fredo.  Where are you going?

I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.

I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.

Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?

I bet you can't guess what happened?

Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.

Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.

What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.

It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.

That's off now.

... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?

He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.

Hello?

Why didn't someone tell me!

You're going to talk to him now.

She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.

Me too, Tom?

There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.

I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.

I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.

They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.

I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?

I think I prefer to see my client privately.

You're right.

Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.

And what's the price of their not finding out.

Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.

Is he related to the witness?

This committee owes an apology!

I'm going to the market.

His brother came to help him.

I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.

Are you Klingman?

I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.

You're a considerate young man.

However I can help you...

Enjoy.

My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.

Why...the Rosato Brothers.

Not good.

I know.

Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.

And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.

I want you to help me take my revenge.

I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.

I want you to settle on their terms.

I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.

Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?

We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.

They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.

Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.

Are we going to eat or what?

We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.

What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?

You want a war?

What's this?

Fuck you.

You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.

I've gotten to know someone who's famous.

It still hurt.  A lot.

Sure.  I loved it.

I like my life.  I'm a free man.

What're you talking about?

Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.

No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.

You ever been married, Hanna?

Yeah?  What's your husband do?

You and he are not doing things?

It's not what you think.

I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.

Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?

The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.

Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.

They're just copies then.  Gotcha.

Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?

Yeah?  What were some of your movies?

"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?

Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.

Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.

We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?

Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.

Is this David's doing?

Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.

No.

Did you kill anyone?

Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?

What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?

What way might that be?

Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.

You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.

After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?

Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?

Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?

This was World War I?

You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?

No.  The girl.

Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?

Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?

I never made it to Korea.

My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.

I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.

I can undress myself, thank you.

You coming, Boone?

Hey, Boone.

You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.

You remember how a production eats up one's life.

But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.

You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.

My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.

Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.

I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.

Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?

Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.

Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.

So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?

Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.

George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.

Just like going swimming, isn't it?

Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?

Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?

You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?

Can we get together while I'm in town?  I so badly want to sit for you again.

Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?

Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...

Fish.

Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."

Jesus, man ... What'd you do?

Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?

I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...

Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...

You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...

Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...

You'll leave -- ?

Or your baby brother. What was his name?

What are you still doing here, Randall?

Not my girl anymore

Who is it -- ?

What's wrong with it -- ?

You seem a little hinked-up ...

It just ain't happening --

Got it ...

You ever feel bad about any of this?

Donny --

Lookit Kip. All grown up...

Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..

How are we supposed to--

Any word, Kip -- ?

That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving

oh.

Why didn't you tell me?

You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?

We'll take it...

You goin' home?

Sure -

No...

It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -

Kip -- ?

You okay -- ?

So what are you gonna do?

"About what?"

You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...

Ain't we good-timing here ... ?

What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?

That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...

Come here --

You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?

You want me to buy her?

Where you off to -- ?

Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.

What's with the look?

So I was replaced by Mitch?

I left town. I didn't leave you.

What kind of trouble -- ?

I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...

She's trouble --

What the hell's that -- ?

Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?

So, you seeing anybody?

She was so great, why'd you leave her?

Stop. What about Maserati Boy?

I pop your hood; find your siren wires

I do ... I cut "em...

Let me worry about The Club ...

You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...

You think it can be done?

I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...

Split it up. Any word on Donny?

Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...

How come ... ?

Which way's out, man -- ?

What? What happened?

Don't go busting my balls. Okay?

Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.

You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?

You think I didn't know what you were doing?

Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.

I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.

Talk? To you? After what you did!

The bag with the envelopes.

I'm gonna need some money.

Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.

At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.

I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.

You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?

we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.

What'll I tell Fran?

Watch this.

What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.

I think you got a good shot at beating the case.

It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.

I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.

Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?

I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :

Where'd you find such creeps?

You ready?

Do you realize what we're involved in here now?

Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?

Are you okay? What happened?

I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...

If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.

Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.

You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.

Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!

Stop brushin' me back!

Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.

I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.

When's the arraignment?

Who'd you call?

Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?

Is this a bad time?

Jesus.

Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.

Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.

Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.

What class did you say that was?

Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.

What is it?

You're in a safe place, Will.

--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--

Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?

What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.

Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.

I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.

Yes. Under two conditions.

I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.

Okay. How?

--that?--

--That edge!

Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--

This job... Do it if it's what you really want.

I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.

Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.

Yeah.

He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?

Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?

I got it.

You moved?

Jobs doing what?

--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.

Hello, Sean.

Why there?

Do you know when you'll be back?

About thirty million to one.

It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.

I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--

No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.

Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.

Well, I can see this is pointless...

"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.

Yes, I do.

Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?

Tell me what you really think.

Watch your mouth.

So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?

So Christ, call her up.

My wife's dead.

My wife's dead.

What happened to that guy from Kentucky?

I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."

They could see that I meant it.

So you might be working for Uncle Sam.

Gerry says the meeting went well.

What did you think?

Do you think you're alone?

But you can't give back to them, Will.

That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.

Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.

Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--

The wrench, why?

Oh, I know.

I know.

I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.

Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.

I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...

I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.

Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.

Free?

You have a lot of brothers and sisters?

Where have you been?

I think I can make it to South Boston.

Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?

Want me to take a look?

C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.

"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.

Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?

I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.

You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.

Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--

Ready, Pa?

Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?

Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.

Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!

That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*

You bust outa jail, Tom?

Lots must a died, too.

Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.

Can all of you work?

Two and a half cents.

We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.

I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?

We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.

*You* find out, I can't.

I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.

And you ain't ashamed?

She's settlin'.

Think she'll hold?

I ain't no more a preacher, you know.

Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?

You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?

We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--

For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.

I stay in my own yard.

I never asked you!

What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.

What's the matter, Grampa?

How 'bout Granma?

Got any plants?

Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.

Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.

Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.

Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.

No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.

How about it, Ma?

And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...

Yes'm, that was it.

Ma, you sick?

Look, Ma!

Didn' you get no sleep?

Was Granma bad?

I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.

How's it feel, Tommy?

Looks like you done it.

She's gettin' prettier, Ma.

I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.

You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.

Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.

Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 

Yeah?

Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.

That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months.

I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.

Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.

Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.

But what about this?

Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.

Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.

I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!

Please don't.

What's these?

Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!

What's this?

Morning.

You people looking for work?

Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.

But wait. I still don't understand what you do.

You do not.

You do not.

So, what are you doing now?

So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?

Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.

Jesus...

Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.

I just play my own collection.

How long has it been?

That's it?

What's your business?

Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?

It's always the little things.

You're fucking psycho.

Flowers. That's funny.

No time.

Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.

He was trying to kill you, right!

Is it something you've done?

What if I come back?

You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.

You kill people. 

We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.

How do you know?

You needn't be so frank with me about your work.

Okay. Repeat this after me.

You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?

I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.

I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.

Like a union?

Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.

But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.

There you go. I left it blank.

I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.

Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --

I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.

Wait a minute--

Throw that away.

They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.

What's it look like?

You have.

I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.

It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.

How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?

What the hell happened to you?

How did you get this job?

This is Annie MacLean.

Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --

I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.

Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...

Doesn't matter.

I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.

You lived in Chicago?

I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.

I thought you lived in Chicago?

The answer's no.

Son?

How did you meet her?

I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...

This is Mr. Booker, Robert.

Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?

Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --

Oh, honey... What happened?

Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...

I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.

What?

You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --

No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --

Would you like to see that?

You buckled up?  You cold?

Gee, this looks like a fun place.

Did you ask him to come visit?

Does anybody out there want something to drink?

Well...  So you tried riding again?

Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --

Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...

I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.

Who's going to want me now?

I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...

Let's bring your bags inside.

Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.

How's everything?

David?

So, what, uh, what train are you taking?

You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.

I don't understand. You just said he said no.

That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.

NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?

You've already made arrangements!?

When are you coming home?

Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.

Huh-huh. You?

You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...

Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?

I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.

Yes?

Where to?

You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.

How's Peterson's holding up for you?

Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.

Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.

Good luck to you, Annie.

... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --

... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?

Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?

Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.

Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.

She gonna be long?

Isn't it like, obvious?

Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.

I can't... not yet...

Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?

Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.

Is the poverty worse, now, you think?

You're looking fit.

Well, that'll happen.

She's rabid, but cute.

What's that?

Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!

Snoop onto them...

Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?

You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.

Oh wow, we are fried.

Did you talk to him?

Dade?

What did we learn in school today?

Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?

Shit! Come on!

I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?

The girl. The girl has the disc I need.

Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.

That's Razor and Blade.

I'm Crash Override.

It has a killer refresh rate.

Yeah.

Make it our first date.

Thank you.

Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.

Alright, so what have we got?

There they are!

Good.

I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.

Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...

You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?

Hey! What are you guys doing in here?

Hello?

You think they're going to bust us?

The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.

So what are we supposed to do?

Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...

Murphy kid turn you down?

From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.

Hello, operator services.

You're late.

I'll take you down there.

Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?

So?

Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.

No, no, we have to get out of here right now.

Shit!

Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.

Can't you find somebody else?

Honey, I don't think their home.

Night Doc.

Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?

Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.

Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.

Can we go home soon Rachel?

Jamie!

I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?

You don't believe that do you?

I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?

You remember Lindsay don't you?

I know! Don't you want to talk to him?

You won't look pushy.

You won't come on too strong.

Call me.

Do you?

You look sharp. You understand?

132 to 133 this is 134.

Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.

You got your riot gun?

I am. Ben Meeker.

Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?

Oh Christ. Doc...

What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?

Loomis. Haddonfield.

I know that Mr. Sayer.

Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.

Hi, Annie, Laurie...

Why didn't you wait for me?

Well, are we still on for tonight?

I don't see anything.

He was standing right here.

It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.

Annie, was that you?

I've already lost it.

Sure, see you later.

I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.

Yes.

I wonder where they went.

I'd like to talk to you, if I could.

A man wouldn't do that...

Sure...

I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.

It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!

I thought you were babysitting tonight.

Are you coming over tonight?

What about the rest of my comic books?

What about the bogyman?

The bogyman!

Are you sure?

I'm scared!

I've given them his profile.

What did he say?

That's just --

Oh!

That's disgusting!

Well, I live downtown.

Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.

I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.

You're joking.

Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.

Excuse me, are there any more claims?

Yeah.

The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.

Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...

So what's the, uh, problem this time?

Now I ca-can't remember.

Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?

What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.

What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?

It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.

Yeah.

Hi.

Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.

Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?

Yeah, you would.

Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...

I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.

Well, thanks a lot.

Page a hundred and twelve.

Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.

Hannah and I are in the last stages.

Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.

Yes, but you, you do care about me.

Lee... uh...

Look, I'm just as much at fault.

Lee...

Mm-hm?

Where're you going?

I want one with you.

I didn't say that.

Are you?

Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?

You matter to me.  Completely.

Oh, Mom!

I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.

How about something to eat?

Are you sure?

Isn't it enough that I can love you?

Me?

Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.

I don't sell my work by the yard!

What's the problem?

You know, you've been very nervous lately.

Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!

Well, he has to rule out certain things. 

I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--

Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.

I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--

Yeah?

You've always had good taste in husbands, so...

Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!

How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?

I want to experience childbirth.

Okay, okay.

Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.

Frederick didn't come with her.

He's such a loser!

Not this Thanksgiving, you know.

I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.

Yeah, can you believe it?

I know, no--  I know.

Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.

What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?

Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."

That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.

Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...

Can we, can we go?

At least I'm open to new concepts!

Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.

...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...

Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.

You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?

Are you, are you out of work or something?

No, I am.  I am.

This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?

No, the reason I ask is--

Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...

Really?

Right.

Oh!

Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.

So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...

Hi.  How you doin'?

Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.

Dad...

Hi.

Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?

You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?

I can't think.

...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.

...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..

Would you mind saying that into your bag...?

It's a poor workman who blames his tools.

Why me?

...why?

<u>Who</u> are these guys...?

Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.

You want to get married...?

Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.

<u>Do</u> it...

...sir...?

If you would see him monument, look around you.

Agent Starling, would you come with me...?

What would <u>that</u> be?

We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.

He is...?

Yes, I did.

Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?

..suitcase...locker...

...unmarked hundreds....

I could have acted on my own.  I was told...

I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, ¥our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...

A fellow with five fingers.

Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...

No. 

I know you did what you could.

Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 

S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 

My husband brought it to me from America.

My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.

...yes.

Yes.  How did you know?

And?  Then?

Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.

I require...

Do you like it at your home, Franklin?

I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.

Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...

...when I... 

You should get Married.

No.  I want to buy a dog. 

Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.

What would you guess, Ardelia?

Give me your gun...

Fine, thank you, but

...my love...

No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...

Because...?

I know where he is.

I want the money.

His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 

...what a lovely perfume.

Speaking of the Vacant Post.

...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.

Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...

Tell me why...?

Then what brings you back?

And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...

For the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.

Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.

It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.

Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...

Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.

I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?

Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?

Talia, don't go!

Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.

...sorry...

Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?

Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!

I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.

Don't say that.

Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.

Gee, thanks.

Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.

So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?

Sawyer. Guess what today is?

I was talking with someone!

Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.

You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.

You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!

Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.

Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.

Where did you get these?

What do you want from me?

Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.

Guess who?

Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.

God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.

No way, no day!

You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?

The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?

It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.

Killing her won't solve anything.

Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.

Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.

No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.

I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.

She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?

Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.

So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!

Do you take German?

Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.

It doesn't work on small animals!

Perrier water!

This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.

Did you miss him completely?

Did to.

Your son's dead and you love him.

Can't you see this is a special moment?

We're breaking up. I am out!

Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...

Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.

Let's kick his ass.

You going to eat this?

The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.

It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.

Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."

Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?

and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.

waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.

I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.

Come on, sit up.

starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.

snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.

You have it.

We don't want to tire you out, dear.

Hello!

James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.

This.

John has fallen in love with me!

How do you know? Did he tell you?

This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!

Poor Father . . .

I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .

What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.

If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.

Of course, yes.

Hint. It's not a geographical location.

Since what?

Must be nice.

I have my connections

GWEN?

You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?

Who's Allison?

What did you just say?

Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.

Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.

Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.

YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?

Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?

OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.

You're alive...

Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?

Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!

You mean... when the car went off the bridge?

But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...

But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...

... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.

I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!

And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.

You should give it to someone with only one leg.

Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.

I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...

I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.

"Anticipation of incarceration"?

He gives a good report and I walk?

Often, uh.

Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...

Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...

Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?

That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!

Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.

Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...

Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.

You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?

Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.

Nothin'.

Bill, listen...

You!

My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?

What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?

Here.  Get off here.

Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...

I... I know that, John...

Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...

It's not right, Gale...

It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"

You just can't bear the idea of good news.

Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.

Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?

Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.

Helluva story!

It's not unthinkable.

He lost a shoe!

LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?

"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?

You didn't... get it on with him?

Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.

They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.

Any particular brand?

Wife, girlfriend or mother?

-- hospital.

And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --

On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --

That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --

Oh, great.

Everything breaks at once.

Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.

Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.

Baby, what is it?

It's the middle of the night, sweetie.

Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.

You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!

And?

Thank God.

Neil, calm down.

This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.

But it's what we want.

They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.

What if someone else buys it in the meantime?

We're going to think about it.

Did you hear that?

-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.

Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?

Do you remember who gave us this?

I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.

Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.

I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?

Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.

I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.

Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!

Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.

And what was that neighbor guy doing here?

I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --

What?

It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?

Let's follow 'em.

Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!

All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.

Is it a king or a queen?

Really?

My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.

Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.

Tough.

You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.

Detective Bedsoe.

She was a good woman.

I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.

Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.

Must you do that?

England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.

Maybe myself.

Thank you, Thomas.

As friends -- always as friends.

You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.

You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?

I'll go first.

What do you think?

Aye?

Do you love me, Conner?

Why are you doing this?

Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.

My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--

You're not an easy person to get to know.

He's in there!

Be careful, Conner.

What now?

Someone broke into the cavern last night.

Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.

Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?

It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?

It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.

The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.

Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.

Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?

I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?

This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.

The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.

Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.

Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?

I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.

Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.

Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?

Jen?  Are you all right?

The car.  All you want is the car?

Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!

<u>Get on the floor</u>!

There's fuckin' blood all over you!

That woman's gonna call the cops.

I have to tell you something --

That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!

Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.

Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?

We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.

Then we might as well die rich.

You with the cops?

Yeah.  I'm Rooney.

Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.

Dennis?  I want you to release those people.

That you, Talley?

I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.

It ain't been a good day, Chief.

It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.

Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?

All right.  Now the second one.

Ow!  Shit!

Mine, too.

We can't carry him.

What?

Kevin left without you.

Are civilians inside?

I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.

Louise?

Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.

Chief, base.

I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.

What's wrong with the radio?

I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?

I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --

Let it go, Captain.

It's mine.  Talley.

The kids are in here!

Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?

How about you and your sister?

I think so.

Where are my children?

Did you find the disks?

That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.

I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?

You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.

I used to work at the Diplomat.

You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.

Excuse me, Colonel.

I don't understand.

Paul, this scotch is exceptional.

Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.

I am strong, Paul, like a lion.

Where are they going?

What do you mean, General?

You know what the Scottish call it?

Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?

A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.

Beer yes, but no whiskey.

Let's go.

Holy shit! Holy shit.

Great, I really need a shower.

The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.

There are no more rooms.

Where are we going, sir?

Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?

Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.

Who did you call?

The commander is not here.

Show us the manager. He wears a suit.

This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.

It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.

I'm afraid you will have to move room.

Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.

Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.

Oh, my God!

What!

Any luck?

Has Roger spoken yet?

How can we help him.

Yes, when you worked as the nurse.

I had you transferred to Kigali.

Let me go. Children get off.

Oh, my babies.

Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.

Where has all our beer gone?

How much beer?

There are soldiers.

"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --

-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."

-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --

More of Price's spook-house bullshit.

Jesus H. Christ!

Oh, for chrissake --

Don't think it'll be a problem.

Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?

There must be some other way out.

Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.

Oh, really: who?

Pritchett, is that you?

Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.

Oh, Jesus....

-- closed.

Thanks.

What? Deep down inside?

Why not?

-- you lose either way, Price --

-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.

Don't touch me!

I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.

It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.

Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.

Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.

What are you talking about?

And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?

Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.

I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.

I was in the middle of --

Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?

Do something!

I'm ready now.

Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.

House 2, Guests 0.

-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.

Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.

Sorry.

Well, I don't.

Please! I need your help.

Rewind that.

Don't know that it does.

Won't do any good.

Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.

Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?

Excuse me?

-- hey! --

Please.....anyone....help me?

Damn it.

It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.

Town records are coming up now.

I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.

Where does this amulet come from?

Can I do it again tonight?

Don't play games with me, little girl.

It's going to hurt us!

She says she's lonely...

Can I have this room daddy?

We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...

Oh my God!  She's in there!

I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.

Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.

What will Aubrey think?

To our family.

Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.

Are you playing tricks on me?

No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.

...set up some more things.

No.

Whoa there...

Oh my God where is she!

We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!

Are you all right?

You're bleeding.

We don't know.

Maura.

Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?

You must be a Londrigan.

...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.

What...amulet?

We must return it, if you want your daughter back.

How long will it take!

Keep talking!

I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...

Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.

Where did you find this?

There's something in there.

C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.

Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?

Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?

Something bad.

Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?

Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.

This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.

Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!

Uh-huh?

You like ... left me a card?  At the club?

Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?

No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.

Joey ... ?

No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...

Thank you.

Do you mind me talking about your stuff?

A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.

Yes. 53

Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.

A girl?  Anyone I should know?

That's your definition of "Hard?"

Three minutes, 51 seconds.

Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.

Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.

"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."

No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?

How.

Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French.....

You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.

I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."

Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?

As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.

Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.

God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....

tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.

Catholic girls are scary...

It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....

This doesn't taste like cappuccino.

Hudson, don't you understand...

How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."

Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...

What's your favorite sport, Hawk?

Good job, not pretty, but good.

I knew it!  I told you it was a fake.

Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....

Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...

Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?

But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.

We'll call it the Flying Donut!

Something short.

Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?

An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?

...Hello?

About seven minutes.

Ol' satchel-butt...

-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --

The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --

Well, she probably had a deadline...

Oh, is that it!

I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --

Oh yes! In Muncie!

I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.

...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?

They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --

Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!

...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.

I can't print this!

Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --

How long've you been down here?

Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.

...What's your pleasure, buddy?

My pleasure, sir.

And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --

But, Buzz --

Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.

Oh, geez.

Yessir.

'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'

...This'll only take a moment.

Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?

...education, were you?

...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?

Ya don't say.

How's that, Sid?

She finds him.

...No money.

She isn't!

Good morning, miss.

What's this?

I've no influence with Mr. Holland.

Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.

Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.

A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?

I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.

That will mean another interview, won't it?

I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.

Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.

What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?

I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?

Have the servants made you comfortable?

A mental case?

It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.

You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.

That's past -- that's over and done with...

Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.

I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.

And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?

But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.

Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.

I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.

That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.

Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.

That isn't true.  You never understood her.

And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?

Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?

Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?

You're staring at me.

You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?

What?

Yeah, that one.

Don't start.

I have no idea.

Don't be dim.

I'm not surprised.

Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.

Well?

You're not going to --

Ready to go?

Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --

Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --

Hi dad.

About?

It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --

Here.

What are you talking about?

A prior engagement overcame me.

Dad stop it!

Fascist!

What you been up to?

... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --

Your toes cold?

Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --

What?

That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.

Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.

Thank you Janey.

Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?

Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?

You okay?

Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.

We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.

They need the money for my band uniform at school.

Please don't.

Oh.

It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --

You ask what the point is?

Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.

Awesome sleet and rain.

Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.

Just be careful.

It's not packed with explosives, is it?

Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?

Frankie opens them with his teeth.

It's beyond mere physical attraction.

Where you going?

Want some gum?

See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?

Wow!

I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?

It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.

Hood residence.

Is this Charles?

Hey Wendy.

They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.

Just thought I'd stop by.

Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?

I love you.

Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.

Who's that?

She your only sibling?

I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.

How much closer would you say you were?

Duggar called him?

Not really.

What about your shoulder?

He would have liked that.

We're sure it's hers?

Good.

That's right.

Where you signed this?

Randy Stetz?

Are you sure about that?

He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.

What do you want to talk about?

That's right.

Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?

No way.

Well her mother didn't buy them for her.

I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.

Will.

You heard me that time.

Stuff.

I don't know.

What about him?

I thought maybe we could talk some more.

That is a picture, nothing more.

And yet you knew what I would o.

I want some more.

Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.

But you're the fairest by far.

Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?

Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!

You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.

Not you my dear.

Stop pestering me then!

He's dead, Claudia, dead.

He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.

It can't be -

You don't remember? Or you never knew.

Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.

Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.

They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.

Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!

Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...

Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.

Read her thoughts.

Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.

They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.

What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?

What do you imagine you are Louis?

Lestat, she's alive!!!!

Why do you do this Lestat?

Lestat - finish this -

My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...

She's here, your wounded one.

Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...

No... You come back to me Louis...

I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...

Well, what a lucky break for me.

You said the slave had a crucifix...

You loved Yvette...

And did you lose her? Did she go?

You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!

You promise to care for her then?

Sorry. Emergencies only.

Listen to me. He's here.

Stupid. Stupid.

Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.

There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.

I thought you were out of town!

No means yes.

He does work hard.

I'm the King of the World.

No way.

Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?

Nice move.

Cancer in a box.

Julie...

There's no way to lock it.

I don't know...

I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?

Yeah.

Never do that again.

We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.

Don't kill me --

Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.

Oh, Will! I'm sorry.

Is there a problem here?

Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.

You think that's a good place to hide?

Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...

To a great weekend --

Come on, it'll be fun.

Why? He can't help us.

Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.

What's going on?

Can't talk right now.

The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.

I need your advice  something has happened  Mr.  Jacks 

If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.

) You feel the symptoms?

I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.

I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..

My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!

Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.

Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.

The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer  a correspondent of some sort 

You are fortunate in your father.

Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.

Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?

They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are  a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.

What if he is?

I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.

I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep - I want to avoid it.

No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.

Your daughter is ill.

Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.

I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.

I've seen men die drunk - and I've seen men die of the plague.

You're crying. Why?

Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -

George . . .

Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.

Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?

By letting me help you.

Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!

Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?

Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?

What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.

You know where he lives?

She's . . .

If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?

What did you stop it for?

It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?

Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?

Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.

Thank you very much.

Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.

Today, over at the house.

She's swell.

Hmmmm . . .

Mother, you know, I can see right through you  right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?

George! George!

No . . . No . . . No. . .

Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.

Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.

Well, no younger than I was.

Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about.

I know it's soon to talk about it.

George.

Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?

Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.

Where are you going?

Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.

Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .

When?

Now look, did you buy anything?

All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.

Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.

Made up your mind yet?

Well, I don't.

Eighteen.

Your . . . your caboose, my lady.

Uh-huh.

My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?

Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.

Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.

Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.

You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.

You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?

Is she running a temperature? What is it?

Oh, George, George, George.

Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.

You can?

Wheee!  Faster!

When do we get to the lighthouse?

Yeah, it's her job.

Maybe by now they are.

Turkeys!  Eat wind!

Putz -- that won't be for hours.

Why'd they decide to move?

What is it?

How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?

We're hung up here.  Snagged.

On your own time?

Chief....

We got a helluva tide this month.

Mike's out there.

I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.

Do I have to?

Pop....

Mike?  Is that you?

Let's see -- you got a minute?

Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.

Carcharadon Carcharias.

Do I have to talk to those two?

Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?

You have to smoke so early in the morning?

Nothing.

In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?

That you were fired.

Because of today?  The beach?

Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!

What're you doing?

What is it?  What's the matter?

No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.

Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.

And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.

Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.

Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?

That's it.  Just do it, all right?

Did you say Cable Junction?

Hang on!

Is that me?

It killed her.  It ate her.

We're going to die.

How old is your cousin?

I want you to meet my cousin.

Get a dance yet?

No class.

Maybe it's gone.

Take a break for a minute, okay?

All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.

Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.

Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.

What is it?

Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.

We'll be over by the lighthouse.

I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.

No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.

That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!

What about me?

Take me.

Michael....

Oh, my God....

Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.

Why don't you take a rest, Brian?

Absolutely.  Good idea.

Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.

Pre-opening jitters.

How come?

Not enough loving.

That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.

Are you scared?

What's wrong?

And leave me down here???

Michael...

How the hell did it get in here?

Kathryn...

Change your mind?

After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.

You want me to stay?

Recovering nicely.

No, we'll go through here.

Honey, what is it?

Yes, you can.

That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?

Somebody better get down there!

Me.

I am.  You're not.

Are you okay?

It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.

I'm sorry.

Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.

It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.

A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!

Let's hope he knows that.

You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!

Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.

That's because I am the shark.

I think that you and I are natural enemies.

Believe me, I am.

I think they'll come out now.

I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.

Herpes?

Besides that.

Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.

No...  It can't be.

Take it up.

Take it up!

The space shuttle has landed!

Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!

Did you see that?

Yes, there is goes.

Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.

I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.

Thanks.  Bullshot.

Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?

How far away is filter number four?

I'll go with you.

We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.

In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.

He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.

Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.

Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?

You'll spoil her.

Thea....

Come on, sweetheart....

Can I make sandwiches...?

What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....

It sure is good to be home....

Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....

No fair, I'm not armed.

Off....

Where's my mother?

I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....

Henny Youngman....

Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.

Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.

That hurt....

Don't be late.

Yes!

I almost forgot....

I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.

It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....

Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....

Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....

I enjoy his company....

You and Sean used to make....

I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....

It got him....

Flies the plane....

How can you just take the plane like this?

I can't....

I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....

You promised me a drink....

The kind with an umbrella in it....

A drink with an umbrella in it....

I borrow it without telling him....

Hurry!

Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?

Can't this thing go any faster?

I wish there was something I could do....

Let me speak to Ellen....

Stop farting around....

Sharp shirt, Jake....

Money is money....

A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....

Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....

You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....

What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?

We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.

I don't know shit about electronics....

How long have you known Hoagie?

How long?

Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....

Half don't...Bring her about....

I'm coming...How close is it?

You told me what?

Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.

I'll do it, Jake.

Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....

How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.

Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....

She's in management....

That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.

Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.

Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?

What do you think?

We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?

Not for me ..

It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..

What do you mean?

Where is everyone?

Why?

That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.

Did I say he did?

You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..

She wasn't lying about the van.

You got a quiet phone somewhere?

What exactly you doing, John?

Now?

Where's your watch?

Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..

Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.

What is that?

Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?

Have you got a match on the bullet?

Have you got a print from the hand?

I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..

I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.

Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?

Did he get you the job?

Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..

Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..

Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..

Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?

D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?

Lotta scratch-marks on your door?

Did Amber have a dog?

Have you been here long?

I'm sorry. I'll get my things.

I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?

If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?

I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?

She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..

I know what you're like ..

Why can't I stay with you?

He don't know that. I didn't.

Who sought the warrant?

What does that mean?

He's happy, darlin ..

Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?

She married some English prick.

You can drive down there, Sir ..

On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..

Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?

Who told you?

Listen to me!

You've never been alone and you can't be alone --

Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.

Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.

And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --

That took guts.

Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?

Hey you.

-- especially one like this.

Truth?

Me too.

Good.  Good.  Glad is good.

I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --

You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.

Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?

Well -- this would be goodnight.

And I really don't know your noises yet.

It's not fair to you.  This whole --

I don't know --

I heard.

That's the girl I love.

I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?

Forgot your keys --

Oh, thank you.

Denver is where he should be.

Not right now, Jerry.

Hey, I'm learning as I go.

Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --

Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.

I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?

Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.

I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.

Is that your porty or mine?

I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.

I'll get you some quick work --

You never had The Talk, did you?

We can still take the offer, Rod.

Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.

Not everyone has what you have.

I'm sorry I asked.

Why not --

I don't want to be friends anymore.

Thanks for coming.

I have to ask.

You're with the sports people on the plane, right?

Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.

Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.

Marcee --

Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.

I'm fine.  What's up?

... dick?

They do, my brother.

And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?

-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...

He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.

He says it's a bad idea!

We can't just...

You look good.

Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.

What did you say?

Young adult.

We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.

What?...WHAT!?

Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.

Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.

PAUL!

We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.

Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.

They never got that big.

It looks intact.

We need to keep moving.

I CAN GET HIM!

Hmm?

Did you read Malcolm's book?

It's strikes me now I never told her that.

Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?

We're safe!

What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?

That's hard to believe.

There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?

Well that's good.

You hear something?

You think I'm all talk, Eddie?

Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!

I didn't know you -- weren't well.

What are you talking about?

No, no, no, no, no, no . . .

But he's the head of InGen!

I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.

Where's the power and radio setup?

You version of it.

She's gutty.

No way.

Then this is our chance.

We can't stay in here!

This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!

You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?

Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.

How many rounds did you find for that weapon?

All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?

That must be interesting.  What drew you there?

He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.

-- way we could safely --

That little black line?

There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:

Ask her.

Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.

I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.

What?

Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!

How many lines of code are there?

You shouldn't use my name.

Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?

Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.

Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.

Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.

But you know, I should  really be the one going .

Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.

Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -

Cheap, cheap, cheap.

Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.

Okay, who's the jerk?

And what are those?

You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -

So what are you thinking?

Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?

Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -

- - and swallows fresh ones.

Are you sure?

It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?

They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.

Alan?!

No. We can't.

Dino droppings?

Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!

Hola, Juanito

Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.

Why not?

Up and down, up and down!

I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?

I read your book.

Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?

I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!

Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?

You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --

A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?

You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.

Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!

You got any kids?

Yeah, they hate me.

Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?

Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!

What?  What can we do?

Hey, we were saving that!

Can't you stop these things?!

Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.

Hear that?  Are you hearing this?

What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?

All night?

C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!

It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?

Your silence intrigues me.

I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?

I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....

What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!

I'm a hacker!

Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.

Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!

You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!

I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...

No, but...

Hello?

I don't know...

Quite a circus.

What?

It's still on.

Are you going to plead insanity?

Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.

So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?

Oh?

Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.

No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.

It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.

Add it to the list.

Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.

You're not going to be there?

It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.

So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.

If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.

Where's he going?

How long will the effect last?

Are you all right?

What happened? Where's Jason?

Where do you live?

Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.

That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.

-- You appreciate my writing.

If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.

A true friend would do it.

Did you see him?

Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.

You wanted to see me, sir.

I did not realize it was obligatory.

How long were you and Eduard --

He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.

When I have no reason to doubt.

Are you free tonight?

Eduard wanted to marry me.

I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.

The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?

You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?

I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.

Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.

And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?

Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.

He was found in the River.  Could he swim?

But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.

-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.

-- You seem amused.

-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.

Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?

This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?

I could always apply there.

Women are all you have on your mind!

But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.

This is filed incorrectly!

We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.

Then that's the place for us!

Get the hell out of here.''!

Father!

Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -

Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -

Where do I charter a boat?

It's the same image - Kong!

Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!

They were just tasting the berries.

Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!

Are you nervous Jack?

Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.

Uh uh.

Why? She's a junkie.

Enjoy.  Well --

Guess!

-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --

Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.

Is that why Klute didn't tell me?

What was better? I made better bait?

I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --

No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?

Oh no, I don't think --

What about?

A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --

How else do you meet them? Pimps? 

Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --

Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.

Did you like my friend Frankie?

Didn't he tell you what you wanted?

What're you gonna do next?

Oh, don't be a doo-doo.

Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.

You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.

What's the matter?

No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.

I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?

Oh look what he did in them.

Go down in my room.

Why couldn't you stay here with me?

I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.

You wanted to, or you are?

Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!

How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.

Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?

All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?

Where, how?

You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.

I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.

You were hired to look for Tom.

Well --

John, how are you?

It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.

Would you like to know what's in it? The report.

Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?

OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.

OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.

No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.

Everybody's got some, I guess.

Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.

That's a lot of people to die unknown.

He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.

It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.

The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.

Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --

Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --

Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.

What do you like best about your daddy?

Greatest.

Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?

When is mommy coming back?

What if she forgets?

Uh, huh...

Okay...Same as usual...

Mom, I mean dad...

I'm sorry.

Salisbury steak.

All it is is onions and gravy.

Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?

Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...

Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...

Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"

Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.

Objection!

Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?

Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?

Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?

Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.

Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.

Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--

Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?

Is that...permanent?

How long was that?

I was not a failure.

I consider it less my failure than his.

I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.

I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.

Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.

Where are you going?

How's the new job?

I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...

I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.

Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--

Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat.  Now just relax, okay? Everything's gonna be fine.

Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.

Wow!

Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.

What the hell is this?

And?

Okay, Phyllis, what's up?

O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.

You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.

So...what's so terrible about that?

Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.

And?

What?

I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.

Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.

Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?

I'll take my chances.

How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?

All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.

Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--

Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--

Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?

Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!

You ever think about getting married again?

What d'you tell her?

He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?

Thelma, if I die--

You heard anything yet?

Ted.

Hey, that's terrific.

Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...

Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?

We must go, Holiness.

Where are you from?

I worry about them.

Mama, my story.

I am sorry, Lhamo.

Goodbye, Kundun.

Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?

Dalai Lama.

He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.

Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.

And the United Nations? Surely?

So, we must face China and all her might alone.

Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.

Your father had been very sick.

Me. First break of day.

The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.

I need to squeeze this brain.

Where is Alsace?

I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.

Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.

India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.

I am scared.

We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.

Good day.

Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.

I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.

What does the butter spot feel like?

I have more men.

Things change, Kundun.

I want to go down there.

Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.

This is Britain.

This is Tibet. And this is China.

Am I running away?

We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.

You, kill me?

I do.

You are unharmed?

No.

You can't take a cow by eminent domain.

Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.

I haven't broken any laws.

Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?

Why are we landing?

Go!!!

Is this a trick?

This is a setback.

Maybe he doesn't play well with others.

Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--

That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?

No!

At school they'd always say "go" first.

But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.

You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.

Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?

What?

How big do the bears get?

What are you doing?

You okay?  Kelly?

Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.

<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.

That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?

Thing we can lift it?

I'm not mushing it.

Watch out!!

Hector!!

We gotta get to Hector!!

What's that?

He's done.  He's dying.

Thanks for your help.

What?

<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?

The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.

You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.

Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.

Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

I was working for you when "us" started, what's--

A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.

No.

Myra.

Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?

You're all right! Where is he?

Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?

What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!

Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -

He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.

Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?

Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?

Starling, Clarice M., good morning.

Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.

We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?

Why not?

What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.

Are you finished?

If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.

State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?

Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.

That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -

Sir, that's great news. But how -

Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?

You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?

Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

I have no doubt of it.

Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?

And the questionnaire...?

I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.

No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.

Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.

Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?

Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.

I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.

"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.

No.

You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.

That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?

I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.

Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?

No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.

They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?

Starling.

I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.

Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.

Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.

Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.

Yes... I did.

My God, you've grown up.

Yes, miss.

You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.

He did?

What?

But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.

Some say that's the way of it.

Will you consider that?

Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...

And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!

That is the truth!

Where do we go from here?

I don't understand!

What did you say?

That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.

Yes, Mr. Poe? So?

You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.

Sir!

Sergeant! Form three ranks!

Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.

Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?

Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.

My son Magua's pain is my pain.

You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.

Such as...?

I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.

What's wrong?

Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...

That it acquires intelligence from its victims?

We're getting out of here just in time.

Jesus Christ...

That's an order!

Where the hell've you been?

I need more light on that, Four.

That was a loud one wasn't it?

How's astronaut training?

Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?

What about our quota?

Something wrong, Cobb?

What's wrong with it?

Shut up, all of you.

No!

Charge set?

I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.

How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?

Forty-eight hours!

What the?...

So that's all you do?...

Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.

You let him get away!

You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.

Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.

How'd you do that?

Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?

We've got to get him to the infirmary.

Clear for pickup.

No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...

Who were you talking to?

What on earth's the matter with you?

What's wrong, did you miss me?

So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?

A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?

The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.

Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.

I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.

Bacon, see what we got.

I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?

He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.

I thought this was a pub.

Like what?

Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?

Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.

Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .

Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.

It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?

Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.

Son?

It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137

We gotta get those guns.

Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.

I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.

There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.

What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?

J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.

And the weed?

Well, what do you want us to do about it?

Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.

That's it all done, we are off.

Everything all right out there, Tom?

Well, what did he say?

You got it all?

I think I would rather just turn them over.

And?

Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.

You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.

What's left over?'

The money, the gear!

We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?

Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?

Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.

I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--

--you're going to be on your own.

You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--

It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.

Do whatever they tell you--

Why don't you start with that?

You're dismissed, Private.

Out of the Army?

If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.

You're dismissed.

Did you know he was going to be there last night?

I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.

Sam the Man.

That the word on our boy?

If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.

That's not the point.

I'm not picking it up.

Yeah, well--

You were in a fight--

Best part of the job.

Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?

It wasn't just you, Bunny.

"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.

Where'd he get all this?

PDA?

Dad--?

Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.

Dad, I talked to the track coach--

Homework?

How's your room shaping up?

Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.

The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,

Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.

You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?

Mikey--

It's a .45.

But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.

Seriously.

Treasure hunter?

Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.

Yeah. I bet he would.

I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.

This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.

I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.

Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.

Is very beautiful, your car.

In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--

Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?

Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?

Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!

"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"

The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--

There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--

Never heard from him again?

I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.

Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--

Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?

You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?

He agreed it wasn't exactly news--

There was a mandate in the last election--

These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.

If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!

Nobody's too busy.

Thank you.

I've seen 'em.

So you must remember Sheriff Wade.

Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?

What about it?

That's how I ruined my stomach.

I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.

Field trip?

I see she built a place up here by the river.

She's done well for herself--on her own and all--

People liked him.

You don't want to be Sheriff.

When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.

Yeah?

You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?

I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.

They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--

We start from scratch--

Uh-huh.

Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--

We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.

Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.

One of Cleroe Payne's boys?

Hello, L.A.

I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.

I could have lost my fucking hands.

What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --

D'Amour.

D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?

Don't.

I'll tell you.

Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!

Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?

If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.

Will you come to him on your knees?

What's the connection?

We haven't slept in the same bed for years.

Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.

He's good.

Are they treating you okay?

I can be very persuasive.

He... didn't have me..  I told you-

Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?

He was the real thing, right?

I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.

Oh God!

Is it finished?

What the fuck?

Sure.

They weren't worth a damn.

Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?

Shit.

Go away.

Whose is the car?

It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.

Who is she?

What the fuck are you doing here?

Why'd you come here?

What for?

Are you satisfied now?

You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?

Don't bother.

I'm sorry, D'Amour...

Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.

The Puritan?

Where'd you learn that?

Was he taking a lot of risks?

You know Vinovich?

He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.

I only wear ties for funerals.

A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.

How the fuck do you do that?

Or murdered, like Nix.

You think I'm an asshole.

I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...

The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.

Call me tomorrow.

Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,

Maybe... I... don't...

Why's that?

Nix! Nix!

Yes! Yes!

I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.

You don't think I've got it to give?

You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.

Hello?

Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.

I could cut the ones that are left for you.

Hey look, it's Sausalito.

Really?

Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...

Oh.

Yeah? But look at you.

And marriage, does that get easier?

That's too scary.

No one ever tells you that...

I'm sorry.

When are you leaving?

I'm going to miss you.

I don't want to go back tomorrow.

You're leaving right now?

Yeah.

I guess she's busy.

Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.

Ok.

I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.

I don't know what to do.

Hair stuff?

Yeah.

You don't have to be embarrassed.

Lauren?

John! What are you doing here?

I missed you.

Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.

I spaced out.

I'm still shaking.

I'm just temporarily off my game.

Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?

Yes.

Seemed...on edge.

He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.

George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?

But your patient is legally entitled to it.

Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?

Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.

Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.

You fucking bastard.

Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.

So...we won?

So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...

May I help you?

Yes... and you are?

Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.

I'll bet.

So...what did you think of the tape.

Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?

Why did he try to kill me?

Do you know your parents' blood types?

Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.

We needed to know all we could.

It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.

I'm scared I'm slipping back.

No oxygen to the brain.

What can I do?

He was trying to tell me something.

Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."

How much time do we have?

I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.

He can see you Thursday.

The police used him as a witness in this case.

Yeah.

What do you mean by that?

Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.

What's this?

Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.

What's the matter with you?

What's up?

Monica.  What are you doing here?

Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.

So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?

Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.

I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.

What are you talking about?

You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.

What?

Sorry.

Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.

Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?

Mom's going to hate it.

So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?

They ever love you back?

I know.  But chances are...

What's up with that?

So what are these Spanish guys like?

You ever think about going back?

One, up.

So...does it hurt?

Your Dad play?

My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.

Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.

So?

What?

What's that?

Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.

What was that about?

It's okay, little baby.

Yo, where's the "D"?

Nah.  Don't sweat it.

Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.

Least she had time for me.

Least you got your priorities straight.

Funny.  I never did.

Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?

So...how's the knee?

Strong enough to get you down the aisle?

It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.

I heard enough.

Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.

I'll play you.

What will this prove?

Give it yourself.

We should head over.

You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.

Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?

Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.

I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.

Where's your dad?

Guess I should have been telling your father.

Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.

Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.

Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.

So what are you gonna do?

I ain't a damn liar.

From your mouth.

And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"

Yeah.

Call 911, Mary, do it right now.

Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --

Oh, she's fine.

I don't wanna talk to you.

Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?

I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.

GET THE FUCK OUT.

Please put your clothes on, please --

Your mother wants to hear from you --

Wilson.

Yeah, but I don't know --

I didn't realize it was that loud.

Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.

No.

ok.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.

Ok, ok. I'm back.

--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.

Just Jim.

Please, yes.

Great, bye.

Why not?

And I bet you say that to all the girls --

What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...

Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."

-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.

...nothing.  I'm sorry...

I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.

Say what you want and you'll see --

You live alone?

Where's Richard and Julia?

Not enough, what do you want?

Can you hold it?

What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --

Richard, shut it and keep it down.

LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?

DAD --

Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?

Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --

Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.

You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?

Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?

Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?

No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.

I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.

She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?  He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?

No.

I'm gonna start rolling --

I would just want to clear some things up:

Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --

She lived in Tarzana.

Yeah.

And your father?

I wouldn'tve asked --

Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.

How long...you think?

He's in here --?

It's interesting.

I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?

You can't just come in here.

I AM CALM.

What does it look like?

I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --

You on any medication?

--- What was that?

WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --

It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --

Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --

Yeah. Yes.

Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --

What happend to you?

I can't fuckin' do this.

Willa Cather.

What were you saying, Stanley?

-- did she talk to you?

You're my handsome man.

No.  No.

No.

It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.

I don't know....

Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?

Hello?

She's asleep.

Was it a call back?

You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --

Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.

You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.

You don't want any water?

Are you on drugs right now?

Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --

Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --

What does that mean?

You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?

Partridge?

Bottled Water?

Yeah.

The fuck is wrong with you?

C'mon, man.

You ready to keep winning?

You have to be nicer to me, Dad.

..sorry...

....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?

You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....

I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --

No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.

....what the fuck, what the fuck....

No, M'lady.

Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.

My Queen...

Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?

How can I serve you in this?

If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.

D'Artagnan, arrest them all!

What are they doing?

Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?

Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.

And people close to him, who --

Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --

Go on.

But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --

Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.

Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.

Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.

I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.

Forgiveness.

I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.

But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?

The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.

D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.

What do we do now?

D'Artagnan, unready?

It worked!

Do I look all right?

That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!

Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.

I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.

What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --

Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.

Where are you going?

You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?

Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?

These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.

This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.

Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --

But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --

Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!

You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!

That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!

Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --

Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!

Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.

I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --

Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?

Sire!  I -- How did you --

Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.

Raoul... Oh, Raoul...

I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.

It's Marvosa -

He walked in on Fleming and took him out.

Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!

Did you hit him?

What did the six-toes have to say?

What?

Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!

Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...

Yeah?

And where the hell is Marvosa?

Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.

No...

What's going on here?

There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.

Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...

Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!

I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.

That was her - the girl... We have to go.

Are you going to be alright?

Where are you going?

Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.

Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...

It was you who did the asking.

He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.

Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?

I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...

Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.

What have we missed?

And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.

The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.

Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.

No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.

We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.

'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'

I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...

Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;

Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?

Get him to Atlanta.

...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...

He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.

Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.

Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.

We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...

You got the message Lecktor called...

He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.

What's being photographed?

I'll take you.

Ride with me.

Is that you. D?

My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?

Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?

No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.

What am I doing here?

Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.

Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?

Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?

Are you a man?

You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.

It's Will Graham...

Linda King's desk.

Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.

Do you know something about that?

He's right-handed.

He's very strong physically.

He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.

To yourself...

Molly?

Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.

To do what?

Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.

Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.

Let's forget who said what to whom...

It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?

Yes. Is Molly there?

Thanks for the lift.

Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?

Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?

I figured I'd ask you...

I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?

How?

She got all right?

Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?

Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.

Then how did you catch me, Will?

Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.

Do you dream much, Will?

What were the yards like?

...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?

Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'

Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!

Sitcom...?

I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!

No.

Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --

Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.

Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...

Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?

What was that all about?

So how can I help you...?

My hair is coming out.

Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?

So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?

I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!

Cue the commercial!

Excuse me -- ?

Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.

Andy, the theater's that way!

Popcorn?

Andy, the theater's that way!

Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?

Why Memphis?

Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??

Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.

Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?

You're NOT DYING!

My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!

I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?

You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...

Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --

Excuse me, Andy...

Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??

Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?

Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.

Sure...

Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!

A -- a tourist.

Then the informant is real.

You don't know.

You're two hours late.

You weren't supposed to relieve me.

Do you?

Did you hear that?

He had an accident.

But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.

Do you always look at it encoded?

Why you're here?

I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.

I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.

Yes.

You can't use that until Neo is out!

Hello?

Who's coming for me?

The cubicle across from you is empty.

Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?

Right now, we're inside a computer program?

Get some rest.  You're going to need it.

The beginning?

And she knows what?  Everything?

No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!

Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --

You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.

But you already know what I'm going to tell you.

Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.

I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.

Who is?

What the hell is this?!

What is this thing?

E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.

Is it?

Should I be?

What did she tell you?

What are you doing?

Are you all right?

See who?

What are they doing to him?

How?

Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!

Cypher, I thought --

No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.

What are your plans?

It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?

No, all we got is $40.

Riverdale.

Well, we want good stuff.

I gotta get the stuff.

Where to?

Next time, bet with your own kind.

Nah.

You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.

Let's get out of here.

I'm going to work this week...I mean it.

Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.

You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?

Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...

Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?

I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?

Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.

I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?

Oh great...hey - Winstons?

...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.

Out!!!!

Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.

Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?

Where's the rest?

I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.

No...no stripping...as the hostess.

Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.

You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.

Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...

No, she's got epilepsy.

Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?

Please take it.

See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.

Bore.

That W.A.S.P. bastard.

Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...

Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.

Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?

Scumbag--

Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?

Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.

I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.

That's your name?

Look who's talking.

Daddy!  Come on, a name.

Daddy!

What, honey?

I know you do, darling.

Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?

Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?

You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.

I don't like cake.

Hi, Daddy, what do you think?

The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.

Honey --!

...This shit's not bad.

What do you do that for?

Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --

Yes, sir?

...See you tomorrow night.

Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?

You're taking this too far, Drew.

We have an arrangement now.

Yes.

It's just a saying, Mr. Black,

Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?

I'm not stepping anywhere --

Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.

'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.

Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --

I'm all excited --

So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?

Yeah, something he goes by --

Is there any more to it?

No.

Sit down, Drew.

Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.

I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.

Mind if I throw up?

What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.

What are their feelings?

What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?

I think it's time you went home, Drew.

Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?

The answer is no, quick enough for you?

You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.

...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.

Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.

Yeah, that's what he said.

I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.

I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.

But I didn't mean to do it!

I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.

Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.

-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.

You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...

'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.

Oh yes, I do.

Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?

'Big'?

-- What kind of childhood did you have?

Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.

Yes --?

Goodnight, Joe.

Yes?

And I'll be a visitor.

She's in a great deal of pain.

Yes?

Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --

Did you like making love to me?

More than you love peanut butter?

Well -- I --

We know so little about each other --

I believe that, don't you?

Did I say that?

That's it?

What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.

Are you going to eat your lunch

Excellent.  What is it?

What way would you put it?

Okay.  Goodnight.

What's okay?

Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.

You are?

Thanks.

You're what?

Then what is it?

Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.

Are you threatening me?

Okay.

Joe, don't do this --

He is --

Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --

An offense --

This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.

Are you giving me orders?

Please.  Talk to me --

Where are you?

About what?

What the hell are you talking about?

I'm sorry --

How're you doing--?

But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.

This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.

This one.

...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --

Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?

Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?

Drew's aboard?

I thought you were in a meeting--?

Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?

Well, I wasn't going to say that --

That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.

Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.

Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.

I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.

What is it, Daddy --?

Well, go get 'em, Pops.

Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.

It'll come back, Daddy.

I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --

I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --

Nothing.

Where's Joe?

Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.

Daddy --

I love you, Daddy --

If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.

Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?

So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?

I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --

Why?

39.

47.

That's it?

Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *

How long have I been here?

This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.

Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.

Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.

You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

Jimmy?

Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?

Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.

Is that what your little note says?

Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.

How do I know he did that to you?

He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.

Who?

He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.

Yeah, I hated it.

Me? Why would he be interested in me?

I'm not.

How?

Don't talk about my wife.

They're not looking for him.

You tell me.

Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.

What the hell you want to go there for?

It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?

Why are you here?

I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -

Prove it.

Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -

How'd you know I was in here?

How do you know this?

How do you know him?

You're not coming?

My wife wasn't diabetic.

No, you won't.

So who are you saying he was?					*

I should kill you.							 *

Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?

We know these people...!

About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.

Oh, yeah...

Just came in.  She's still alive.

We're not certain...

How many?

Make it 40%.

Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.

There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...

My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...

Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...

Where would I go?

No part of it wasn't real.

What...?

You afraid of violence?

Yeah.

He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?

How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?

What is it?

White gangs...?  It doesn't track.

So?

Where'd you go?

Detective Crockett.

So what do you want?

Never heard of him.

What are you talking about?

I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.

Alonzo...!

Oh, good...

Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?

Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.

Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.

Then what were we talking to you for?

I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.

Yeah?

Must be some mess back there.

Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?

If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.

Okay. Never argue with a man.

That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?

For money.

Oh hell, forget it.

What's in your socks?

You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.

What for?

The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.

Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.

Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.

Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.

Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...

Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.

I read it.

Keep the goddam blanket on.

Sounds like they knew you.

You're what?

Hell, don't cry about it!

Thanks, Joe.

What d'you want?

Here. Don't even thank me.

Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?

You really want to do business?

Sold. Let's go.

Twenty months?

Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.

You got that, shit face? Asina...

Too bad you didn't have a machine.

--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.

Where you staying, Dad?

How do you like it?  Istanbul?

I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.

Those mountains? are they?

Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...

What's your father do?

Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.

Feeling all right?

How much did you have?

You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.

What's wrong?

No... It looks like your going to have a new court.

Okay?

Shit!  Shit!  Shit!

'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.

Never was anybody like you...

Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.

Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.

You're ayip!

Know what?

You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 

Lawyers?

Hey, you can't...

Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.

Peter...

Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?

The Department of Public Health...

We'll be back at the platform in...

Oh, that's gonna work.

I only got...

You feel anything?

A mistake.

Can we get this car there?

What are you doing down here?

The lights come up, you pull the switch.

What are you putting that crap on me for?

But the power...

He didn't do it!

Just inner chambers...

Do you think we did the right thing?

You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.

Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.

Honey, just leave it.

He was just doing his job.

Oh, no, you were-

Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...

So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...

It's no use! They know we're in here!

We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!

Talk to me.

An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.

This wing configuration. I've never...

Sure.

Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.

The profanity bothers you?

I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?

Thank you so much.

For a while I thought I might go crazy.

Done?

Then who did?

But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."

Then light the match, Paul.

I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?

See, isn't this nice?

Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...

I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.

You--fooler...!  Did I do good?

It'll only take a second.

Here, in case you think of any ideas.

Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.

Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?

Annie, I think we should have a toast.

To Misery.

Well, it certainly says you.

Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.

Paul, I know you've been out.

I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--

You really think Sheldon's out there?

Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.

Just leave it, all right?

That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.

Yes.

Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.

No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.

Yeah. They're in the semis.

Your room.

Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.

You won.

To win?

You picked another winner!

A change of plans?

I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.

She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.

Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.

Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?

We're due to take off.

That's it?  That's it? That's it?

Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'

How're we doin', then?

What can we do' mate?

No.  You just looked as if you did.

Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.

I wouldn't do that.

Hola..

What's you name?

What's the population of Seville any idea?

Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.

Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.

Before you are.

He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.

We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..

Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?

-- his left jacket pocket.

What did you think you were doing!

- you who don't have a conscience.

No.

No.  Should I?

Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.

Like what?

Excuse me?

Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.

Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...

Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?

You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...

To friends.

What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!

You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.

Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?

But why tell us?

Nothing but civilians, Gene.

Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?

Satisfied?

I'm walking.

Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.

That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?

We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.

I just need you to be safe.

Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.

This is Kittridge.

Whoís dead?

I donít think so.

No sir.

Yes.  I see your point.

Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.

Kittridge.

Can I ask you something, Kittridge?

If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?

I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.

The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.

You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?

It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?

On what?

It's quite out of the question.

Ah, but, we're asking about you.

Mm - Hmmm...

Very good.

What sector's the air conditioning?

IMF mainframe.

Zero body count.

In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.

OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.

Then what am I doing here?

I'm willing to take the chance.

Tell you what?

I guess.

..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.

Whatís going to make him do that?

Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

Such a nice ass.

How long until we reach the Chunnel?

The Shawfish?

Very good, Mr. Johnny.

I won't pay for nothing.

I don't wanna talk about it.

Rita. Pass the wine.

Where's Ma?

He got hit by a bus.

He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.

Here.

You're married.

It's wrong to just let them go.

I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.

Yeah, this is Ronny.

What's wrong can never be made right. 

Have you come from my brother?

Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!

When your husband get hit by the bus?

Yes.

What are you doing!

A bride without a head!

What? What have we done?

Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!

Snap out of it!

Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.

What?

They get some turnout for this stuff.

Beautiful. Sad. She died!

Let me go home.

You've gotta get outta here.

Will you marry me?

What time is it?

Yeah.

I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.

There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.

Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.

I can't. I need my family around me now.

And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!

How's the mother?

What the hell happened to you?

A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!

What about the moon?

Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.

Alright.

He should pay.

Talk to him.

Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.

That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.

My mother's recovered.

The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!

Who was that?

No idea.

Loretta...

Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?

I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.

Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.

I'll remember that. What do you do?

Temperature's dropping.

We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.

That's my house.

Yes.

I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.

Cosmo.

What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.

She's got it.

Burn them.

I see.  Yes, of course.

Get away!

What?  Ridden on a horse?

You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.

Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!

It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.

Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...

There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.

Well, how did you become king, then?

The same!

Oh!

Oh!

Of course.

What word?

Look!

Stop that.

I'll do you for that.

I'm invincible!

Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?

And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.

Nu!

What with?

There!  Look!

What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?

Greetings Tim the Enchanter!

What?

Look, you're a busy man ...

... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.

Too late.

Behind the rabbit?

Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.

You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!

I'm averting my eyes, Lord.

... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.

Exactly.  So... logically ...

Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.

What is your favorite colour?

I can't.

Why?

Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!

Gosh - Is he all right?

'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....

One day, lad, all this will be yours ...

Father, lad.

You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!

How?

No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.

Leaving the room ... yes.

Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.

Right.

And make sure he doesn't leave.

No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.

Well, look er, I ...

We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!

Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?

Sir Gawain.

No look, really, this isn't nescess ...

There's nothing wrong with ... that.

Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...

Well ... yes ...

They're all saying the word ...

What's he do?  Nibble your bum?

He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...

Not bad, not bad.

If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.

What?

I'm not sure I do, Archie.

She's got an army of people to get her up and out.

You've got three broken ribs, man!

She'll get over it.

And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.

Hey, Barney.

I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.

It's the Queen's decision.

I wish to see my mother.

What did you say?

Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.

Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.

By whose authority?

The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.

Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.

Her Highness' Equerry.

Do you?

Awaiting my orders.

She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.

That can wait till the weekend.

This is a slur on her good name.

Dare say you can be taught.

You're injured.

The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.

Was there never ambition?

Then I envy yo.

To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.

They don't see it.

I promised to protect her from people like you.

Mr Brown.

You are well?

My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.

Mr Brown.

It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?

What are those?

His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.

They're ready now.

John?

Ma'am?

I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --

-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!

Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.

I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.

Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--

A fine choice, sir.

A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.

The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.

No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.

The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.

He appears to be ... standing by his horse.

Well?

Unwell?

Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.

Please make sure it does not happen again.

Who told them that?

I have a letter, ma'am.

Where is my son?

What is the matter with him?

How the hell did you do that?

We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...

Dead?

Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?

So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...

I have to talk to you.

No, in person.  Now.

Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.

It is.

It turned itself back on, Nick.

We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...

Then leave her.

It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.

Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.

Then where do we go?!

You mean we learn the rules...

Jesus Christ!

I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.

I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.

Okay.  Give us a kiss?

And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.

So that's what we almost died for?

Christ...no time...

Go for it.

How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!

But I don't understand...

I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?

We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.

"Escape"?

So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?

So what do you think?

Cool.

One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.

Someone's shut off my money!

And?

A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?

There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?

... What??

I guess I've come to quite a place.

It's unbelievable!

Wow!

Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.

You're really something Coco...thank you.

I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.

Betty.

You're still here?

I can call them... I can call my dad.

Yes?

What do you mean? You're Rita.

Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?

I don't know.

That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.

Okay... but just...just to see.

Okay.

There's nothing?

Strange to be calling yourself.

What's wrong with that?

"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."

Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?

I don't think...

Rita... I know what you're doing.

Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.

So, you came to see if he's out there?

Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.

Nice wallets.

Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.

Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.

So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.

Hardly.

Why should we trust you ?

Now where do we go ?

Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?

Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?

McCay knows ?

What are you doing ?

You took an awful big risk back there.

How long till the room fills ?

Do you have something better to talk about ?

And you believe that ?

Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?

Where are we going ?

Do you know where you're going ?

What about you ?

Just stop it. End it here.

That was eleven years ago.

NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.

That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.

The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.

It's fine thanks.

Don't.

Stop the hydraulics.

Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.

When you are ready.

Parking tickets ? That's it ?

A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?

I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.

Of course.

I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.

So who are these people with the Boss ?

That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.

I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.

Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !

Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?

Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...

This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.

Hello.

Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.

Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !

I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.

It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?

Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.

Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.

No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.

Do you still teach?

I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.

Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.

This is California, anything is possible.

Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.

Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...

I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.

It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.

Wow, you walked out with my mother?

She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.

Do what?

Okay, no problem.

Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.

Seriously.

Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?

The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer

There's still a big spot on the floor.

Yeah.

Totally.

Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?

Never heard of him. 

Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.

I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.

What're you saying?

Sure am, who are you?

I was hoping I'd get to meet you.

Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.

I'm glad you're here.

And she saved it.

Do you have any pictures if her?

She's beautiful.

It's good to see Maggie again...and you.

Hi.

Is it okay if I drink this?

Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.

Hey Vada. How's your report coming?

There's water in your bathroom.

Thanks....

Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.

You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.

You ratted on my mother??

Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.

Does it work?

Uh oh...

It's dangerous!!

Hey look!

Yeah I guess...sort of.

Yeah?

...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.

An adventure?

No problem.

Well Rose was being very thorough.

Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.

And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.

Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...

No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.

What's with the touching, why was he touching you?

Hi!

Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.

Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.

I think this place is just fine.

You're Nick's mother?

I'm just tired.

Bye Aunt Rose.

So what's wrong?

Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.

Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.

They're enormous, I know.

What's this? December 8th, 1958?

Why not now?

It would be fantastic.

Beidermeyer?

No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.

I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.

Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.

Of what??

Danny?

Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??

I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.

It's still available I hope?

I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.

Stiffs??

Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.

Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.

Rock?

Do you want to?

Goodnight Shelly.

I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.

I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.

How's it going chef?

Well, you were pretty great!

Can we see it from the back yard?

Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.

I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.

Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.

Of course not.

It's for school, for summer writing class.

Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.

Dad?

She likes to play bingo.

Did I kill my mother?

The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.

In the garage.

I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.

Why?

That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!

Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.

Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?

No, no no....

Sure.

Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.

So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.

No.

Do you like her?

Really?

She's shy.

Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?

So how come you're putting lipstick on?

I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.

Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?

Daddy??!?!?!

Goodnight.

Eeeeuuuww, gross.

Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!

Where's your bike?

Hmmmm, interesting.

Is that your Dad?

Do you remember her?

What do you think it's like?

Bed wetter!

Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.

Got it!

Jump in the water!!

Hi Vada.

You can come to my house for dinner?

I dunno..

For what?

Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.

Stay, huh?

Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?

Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.

Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.

I've lost interest.

He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...

He's adored me for nine goddamn years.

Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...

I did what I came to do.

All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...

And loving him means loving all of this.

But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...

So... one almost has to...

Uh, Kimmy...?

When are you gonna come clean with your folks?

If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.

I saw the show.

Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...

And you think he's kept this to himself.

I haven't caused... a problem, have I?

I've been calling for days!

Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...

And she's all wrong for me!

Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.

How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?

No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.

Every day.  She makes the bed.

Waiter! Check, please!

Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...

Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.

I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...

It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...

Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.

I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.

Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...

And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?

Dance card filled?

Where did we first hear th...

So we heard it... like, right that... that first...

Takes me back.

No accents today.

Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...

What happened?

Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...

Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.

... your one chance for true happiness?

You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...

Almost three.

Because I could come...

... I'm partial to the tight end.

Maybe it's happy there.

You got the money?

You're from out of town?

We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.

Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.

Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.

Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.

No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?

Barbara Jean.

That's what he wants.

Well, how about the shopping center?

What's he running for?

President?

It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.

Yes, but we're just singing.

He saw us at Tammany Hall.

Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.

He got killed at a turkey shoot.

Haven's not going to talk to me.

HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.

Mr. Green?

You want me to wait?

Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.

Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...

She had on high heels?

Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?

You in music?

Wrecks.

We don't mess with accessories.

The car broke down.

Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.

Listen. Maybe I should go...

I want to get the dog off my bed.

Okay. I'll be talking to you.

Bye.

Well...How have you been?

Hello.

Stay.

Premeditated murder.

Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?

You know who that is?

Yes.

Are you sure you know what you're doing?

Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...

What for?

You don't know how pleased he'll be.

Where are you going?

Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...

You know Bill is really mad at you.

No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.

Why?

You go to school together?

You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.

Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.

Got me an audition tonight.

It's not bad.

You think it will?

More or less.

I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.

Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?

Mickey!

Looked like an interview to me.

Who is we?

Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?

Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.

How is it?

You ready, Donut?

Yours.

Manson beat you.

Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.

Sorry about that.

We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?

Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.

You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?

This is crazy. You can't escape like this.

...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?

Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---

How can you say that you 'admire' them?

Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?

Hypnotizing.

Through the power of the simple word---

Apparently, they've seen all our films.

Take a wild stab!

Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...

Roger, no.

Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.

Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.

Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.

Who?

They passed the 'edge' along to us.

By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.

Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.

Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?

Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.

Two guys?

No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.

Three.

Why don't we make it three deputies and you?

How 'bout that furniture plant?

Fill her up?

Boy - you hear me?!

Want to talk to you.

I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!

That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.

Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?

She done moved to Detroit.

Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.

Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.

I'm a teacher.

Yes, aren't you?

That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.

Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.

How come you stay 'round here?

You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?

I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.

Ain't your fault.

Yeah. It's just like I figured.

Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.

Goin' to see my kid.

I'm just going in to do my shopping.

What d'you mean?

What happened, Duff?

Don't push me, Duff.

That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.

What's wrong?

Everything you cook is good.

How would you like to have a baby, Duff?

Don't look so scared.

You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.

Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.

Duff, I love you.

Okay.

Just get her drunk.

We was just leavin', fellows.

'You Will Anderson?

I said, I come to town with a girl.

Couldn't get the words out before.

How often does he get like that?

You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?

I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?

Pour your own trouble, Will.

He's your son.

Got a thick feelin' here.

Let's go.

I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--

How long's it been?

Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?

Let me get you another glass of wine.

They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?

She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?

Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.

A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?

We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.

Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.

Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.

I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.

First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.

What's this?

He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?

Yeah, well it's working.

Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.

You've got your orders.

Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.

Ya learned good. So, what's happening?

Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.

So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.

We're doing fine. Take the next right.

I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.

Never heard of him.

What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.

That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.

Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.

Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?

It'll flatline your ass.

Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.

One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?

This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.

You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...

Where did you here that?

I know who you are.

You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.

I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.

Maybe something's onto him.

How long have I been out?

When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.

Yeah... fine.

What's wrong? Don't like flying?

Case... Are you alright?

You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.

Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.

Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.

How are you at riddles, Peter?

So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?

Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.

Forget it.

The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.

Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.

Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.

Okay. That's bad.

How about this?

Cuuuute!

Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?

Wow. It's packed.

wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.

How many times have I fired her?

You've done five of my ideas.

They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?

Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.

No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.

Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.

And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!

Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.

Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.

Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.

Better person than I.

Wow. This must be big.

Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.

No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.

Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.

Whoa. Deja Vu.

Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.

You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.

Oh right. The Spiderman incident.

Yeah. To watch the world go by.--

Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!

So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?

What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?

Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!

Billy Prince is asking you to prom.

Into our group.

We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.

Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?

That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...

But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.

Uh-huh.

When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.

<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>

You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?

I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!

Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?

Who told you to choke up that way?

What are you doing here?

The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.

Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?

This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?

At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.

What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?

Here.

So, you feeling anything?

Any ghosts in here?

Well, what am I supposed to do?

Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.

Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?

You should eat something - you'll feel better.

What's so funny?

Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.

Hi, guys.

I'll need to take her things.

Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!

Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!

And you don't want to keep him waiting.

Menthol, regular, ultra-light.

I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.

So what do we do about this creep?

Kincaid -- we should find the others first...

To old friends.  And your new dreams.

That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?

You like gymnastics?

Nancy!

He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.

Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.

Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.

I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.

Crossed over?

Tell me about the kids.

Anything?

I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.

My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.

Just until we get things under control.

I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.

Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.

The truth.

Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.

Who would know where they were hidden?

Nancy...

And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.

We've got work to do.

What was that?

You do volunteer work at the hospital?

You said something before...about laying him to rest...?

She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.

Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.

Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.

Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...

Hi.

I wonder if you could tell me where the...?

Wait a minute.  What about me?

And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.

No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.

So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?

Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?

No, thanks.  I'll just look around.

Probably best not tell anyone about this.

Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.

No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.

Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?

Too complicated.

It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.

I'm sorry.

I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.

Why?

I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?

I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.

Cartwright.

Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.

You like Chagall?

You've got big feet.

Oh please sod off.

Wow.

What?

How are you doing?

I thought I'd give it to you.

I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...

You were saying...

Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.

Still loves you though.

Bernie.

That's nice.

Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.

What do you think?  Good move?

Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.

Mr. Thacker?

Right -- want another one?

Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.

Buggered?

Any more announcements?

There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.

Oh God no.

Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...

No, sir.

No, sir.

No, sir.

I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.

Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.

There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.

Well, okay.  There's this girl...

Oh my God...  Hello.

Yes.

Was it you?

Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.

Bad news.

At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?

Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.

Yes, Mister Harding?

You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!

Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...

We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.

Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.

Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.

Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.

Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?

Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?

I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!

Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...

Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.

Good. Why don't you join us?

Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!

What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!

Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.

W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!

Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!

Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!

What for?

Let's go, for Christsakes...

Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!

How ya gettin' out, Mac?

Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!

There they are!

Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.

Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?

Christ, they even got my first grade report card here...

Martini!

What are you doing?

Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?

Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!

Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.

Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!

I'm busting outta this place.

I'm the coach!

You can come back later!

Don't you have any clubs?

Why not?

Hear what?

You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.

Right!

I wanna go home!

Is that so?

I don't, Doc...

Doc, what can I tell ya?

When?

Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.

Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!

What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?

I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...

Please follow me.

Yeah...

Hi.

Yeah, how much you wanna bet?

Yes, I see it! I see it!

I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.

Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.

How 'bout twenty?

We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?

Is everything all right?

The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.

I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!

What happened?

Is he in an asylum?

Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.

She was your sister.

Your grandmother?

You ask what room he's in, okay?

My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?

Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.

I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?

Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.

I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.

Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.

Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.

I'll bring it back as soon as I can.

It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.

Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?

This is his fiancee.  Who's this?

Where are you going?

That's not the point.

How could you do this to me?

You're limping.

To the foot doctor.

And she's a knock-out, too.

Hi.

No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.

I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?

Really?...

I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?

What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?

No.

What's he do?

He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.

Come on, it's not so bad.

Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.

It's still the new year...

Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.

Thank you so much.

A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...

Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.

Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.

What are you doing?

You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.

I just got a dial tone--

Ah ha!...

Your brother?

I'm hungry.

Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--

What did you say to her?

Not if you don't count the sixth grade.

Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?

No... Like a psychiatrist.

Why?

Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.

Who said I was going?

Peter found him?

It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.

And he is living proof.

I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.

A porco?

Oh.

No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.

You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--

Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?

Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.

Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.

He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?

I came after the woman I love.

And you didn't tell her?

And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--

Right now?

It'll do.

You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.

Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.

We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.

Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.

Mmhmm.

Mmhmmm.

A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.

Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?

It was you, Charley... .

Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.

How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?

I think we're O.K.

I'm with Terry.

What did that man mean when he said you were... .?

It isn't brains. It's how you use them.

I can get home all right from here

I remember you were in trouble all the time.

Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?

The Golden Warriors.

How do you like that one?

If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.

Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.

A dive? You mean, into the water?

What made you want to be a fighter?

He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.

I I'd like to, Edie, but  there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says

What are you crying for?

I I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And I never knew a girl like you, Edie.

Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.

Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now but I think we're getting in love with each other.

Pigeons... .

Told him what?

Don't tell me don't tell me!

I had to, Edie. I had to see you.

Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.

Edie...

Charley.

Terry, no, no... .

Terry, for God's sake.

Edie.

My pigeons... .

I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.

What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.

Give me that gun.

You can!

You still call it ratting?

What do you think?

I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.

You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.

Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?

Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.

Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again.  Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?

I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?

Better.

Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .

You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.

Is Johnny in?

Hey, Skins  --get away with that sheet metal all right?

H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?

You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.

Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.

You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?

You don't think he'd be helpful?

Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.

My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.

They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>

That sudden?

I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.

But they are not yet one of us.

I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.

She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!

Well?

I understand, Master

There are others.

Have we in some way made you angry, Master?

It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.

There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master

Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!

What do you suppose for?

Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...

You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?

I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?

You didn't visit him in prison.

I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.

I don't know where he is.

Go away, or I'll call the police.

Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?

Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.

I'm just saying she wasn't scared.

Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.

And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.

There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.

"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.

Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?

It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?

So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?

I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.

There's still time, take me up on my offer.

They look like plain old rocks.

What?

From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.

No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.

Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.

All right, but...

Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?

You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.

You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.

Ironic, isn't it?

Quite a mess.

Who?

You know, I'm not in homicide any more.

Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.

Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.

Who's sitting here?

Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.

Boy, it stunk in there.

How many was that?

You don't seem all that scared.

Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.

I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...

Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.

I mean, romantically.

Think I could have them back?

There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.

Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?

Don't leave me.

Oh, God...

You like taking risks.

Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.

What were you gonna do with me?

You know I saw you on the street.

So.  What's your point?

Wait in the car.

Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?

I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.

Looks like tonight.

You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.

You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.

I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.

Foley?  That you?

Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?

What's it mean, "No Hair"?

And so now you're off to Glades.

Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.

But you're sure we've met, huh?

Do we have a gun in the car?

Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.

What's going on, Glenn?

But I thought the whole thing was your idea?

And is Foley a part of this?

But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?

It's a guy you know.

Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.

You're a fighter?

You're not my type.

You like to sit down?

No.

He's about to.

You were talking in your sleep.

"Hey, yourself."

He doesn't even look like that.

Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.

But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.

You wave back?

Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.

So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.

Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.

A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...

Did you pay the guy the reward?

What?

I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...

Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?

We have a problem here?

What, good-lookin' sumbitch?

He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.

Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?

You're Walker, right?

That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.

I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.

Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...

Who the fuck taught you to fly?

Land of the free...

How could you do this?

Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.

Then why are you looking for her?

Sorry.

I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.

Get me into a plane!

Where are we going?

What's there?

They're all over us!

You hear my okay?

Land of the free.

I'm out of ammo!

Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.

Fun today.  Like old times.

What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.

It's shorter than our practice runway.

I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.

That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.

Sorry.

C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.

Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.

There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.

Don't get smart with me, son.

Danny's not coming?

There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.

Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.

I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.

I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.

Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.

Leapin' Jesus!

If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!

You see us as capable of such a blow?

Hello, Lilla!

Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.

What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventyfive? Eighty?

It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.

What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?

r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..

Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.

I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.

They're waiting. Come on.

He is kind of cute, isn't he?

Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.

What happened?

Welcome to the singles' scene.

Peggy Sue!

And we're here on the couch...

There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.

Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.

I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.

Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.

Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?

Want me to drive you home later?

Looking good out there.

A lot's happened since last weekend.

I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?

You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!

I'm sorry Charlie.

But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.

Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.

I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...

But what has to be different?

What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?

What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.

Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.

What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?

Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.

Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.

I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.

Come back to me.

I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.

Did you study for the test?

Terry! Slow down.

You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.

Don't get your hopes up.

Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.

Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.'

Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?

A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.

Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.

It's Charlie!

Young lady, you're drunk!

I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.

All right. But this better be good.

For me?

I closed my Christmas club.

I wanted to apologize for this morning.

Yes.

Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?

A new car. We can't afford a new car.

Does everybody have to hear?

Jack, I was just trying to help.

Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.

What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?

You're looking pretty chipper this morning.

Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?

Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.

Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.

Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?

Maddy's party.

I'm not the maid!

You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.

Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.

I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.

The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.

Dancing with you.

I have to talk to you. It's very important.

You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes

But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?

You're giving me the creeps.

What're you doing?

All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.

But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?

Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.

Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.

For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.

No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.

You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.

Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--

I hope he doesn't have rabies.

How long ago did this guy retire?

What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?

Hey! How was your first day at school?

What?

I think so.

Just out.

What are you talking about?

What's his name?

Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.

It's weird...

Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?

How long have you been here?

How did it go with your father last night?

Mom...

If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.

Thanks, Walter.

Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.

I'm not ready to die.

I'm ready...

We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.

You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.

Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!

New baby?

Congratulations.

Nine.

Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.

Thanks for your time.

Who'd you get?

Get it?

What do you want?

You think I'm uncomfortable...

What?

Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...

We proceed, representing your estate.

Particularly, Charles.

In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?

You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?

Do you need a break?

While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?

Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?

Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?

Mom?

Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?

Were you recently promoted?

In what way?

I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.

Objection!

Leave that.

Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?

Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.

You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!

Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.

Don't know, Joe.

I'll see you in an hour, max.

Yeah. Do I have a case?

Now that you mention it...

Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.

I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."

He was doing a great job.

Don't wanna miss this.

What? What is it?

Probably okay to talk to me now.

Audrey? Oh, Audrey....

You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?

Heard about it. Just never seen it.

Why, what'd you hear?

But I just wanted to say --

Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?

We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.

Step aboard, Carolyn.

You barely know them.

This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?

What?

No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --

...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....

He used that?

I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --

15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.

Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --

Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --

You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.

You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --

Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.

Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.

Smoke screen for what?

You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.

This does not help us, Johns.

Just shut up, okay?

Why did I fall on you?

I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?

You mean that "load" of passengers?

Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --

You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?

I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.

They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.

The sled as a shield....

Oh, no. No, no, no....

And pointless.

A toast to whatever he just said.

What the hell are these?

Found somethin' worse than me, huh?

You'd cut me loose, Boss?

Are you fuckin' kidding me?

<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."

Such as.

What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.

Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.

Dr. Zaius --

Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.

Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...

Seal the cave?

As you wish.

Where does the river lead?

You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.

When are you going to show me what's in the cave?

They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.

Look -- she remembers.

Flight is a scientific impossibility.

'Then how do you account for me?,

You didn't think so then.

Well, maybe they're not.

A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.

Any particular reason?

You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.

Hmph.

Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.

State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.

There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith

He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.

Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?

Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?

You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.

Air leak. Died in her sleep.

Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?

Scarecrows?

We got off at the wrong stop.

Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?

Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.

All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.

That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.

Who put them up?

You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!

No.

However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.

A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?

There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.

I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.

Then there is another jungle?

Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?

Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?

What is this?

You! ... You knew about this?

Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.

Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.

He's moving his fingers!

Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?

How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?

Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.

WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!

...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?

Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.

Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 

Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.

You gonna wipe your ass dis time?

Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.

You lame Taylor?

Does he have a metal plate in his head?

Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!

Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.

Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...

Where's Lerner?

First time?

Dawn! That was it!

And you, do you believe?

I'll go with you.

What you got there - beers?

You WHAT? Say 'gain.

Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 

Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.

Whew! - where that come from?

Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.

I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...

Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...

No thanks, I've seen Seattle.

Vancouver, B.C.

No thanks?

Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.

I think I'd like to dance.

Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.

Good evening, Miss.

Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...

Sit down then. We often have a double up here.

You said it wasn't a tragedy.

They'll know whether he killed himself.

There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.

What time is it?

Dance? Tonight?

Certainly not to me.

That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.

It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?

There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.

This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 

I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.

No.  I paid him off.

Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.

You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?

Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.

If I understand what you meant by that.

I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.

Time's up.  I'm off the case. 

Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.

But I tell you---if you'd only understand.

Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.

Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.

What have you got on Miss Mayfield?

Bluff. You've waited too long.

I go home and paint the kitchen.

There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night

And without much discrimination.

So you're not a cop.

How are your teeth getting along?

What?

Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.

Where?

Time for a little chat?

Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?

I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--

Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.

Mitchell was too drunk.

Want to walk out... or get thrown out?

So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.

What are you doing here?

Passkey?

One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.

I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.

You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.

Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.

This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.

Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.

"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."

Not too hard, is it?

Where's the shell?

You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.

I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.

How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.

You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.

May you what?

Did you ever have a serious operation?

And if you didn't believe me?

So far.

Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?

It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?

Well, find out.  Who's covering her?

"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?

There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.

So-so.

Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.

Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?

I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.

She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.

You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.

My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.

It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.

I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?

Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pâté.

It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.

Thank you.

Shall we go?

Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.

Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.

Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?

Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?

Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?

I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.

And you'll join me in a sambucca?

It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.

I thought it was tremendous.

I couldn't bear for it to end.

No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.

Me too.

I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?

Did she talk about me?

Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?

Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?

Shall we have a drink or something?

We don't seem to get much time to talk.

Blasé and epicene.

That's enough of that.

What have you been up to?

The torture of small children--

Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?

Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.

And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.

Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.

You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.

You're so famous now.

We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.

Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?

It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.

Friends of yours, huh?

You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?

How you figure?

Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.

Utah, you copy bruddah?

You gonna pull?

You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.

We're wasting time.

I can't do this.

Three seconds... two... one...

Yeah?  What?

This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--

A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?

Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?

Smart.  You burn time in the vault.

Yeah.  What's your theory?

No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.

Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?

Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.

I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.

I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.

Who's the girl?

Meaning you were expendable.

I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--

Well, I saw you and--

Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?

I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.

That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.

Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.

I can accept that, it comes with the job.

You're wastin' your time.

You're looking well, Dutch.

That's over the border, General.

Major, you'd better take a look at this.

I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?

Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.

Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.

What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.

Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.

What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?

Nice car.  Yours?

Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.

You're joking.

Get in.  This side.

Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...

Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.

Let's talk some more first.

Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.

I think he wanted you to tip him.

You really are a very beautiful girl.

What do you like?

Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.

No?  Why's that?

Not... quite.

Four thousand.

I'm not just talking about sex.

Hello?

You're upset, huh?

Was someone rude to you?

Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?

You're really pushing it, bringing me here.

Real genuine guy.

Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!

Edward, I can't.

If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?

Right.

Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!

Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.

Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.

Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...

Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...

Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.

Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.

And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?

Why do you want to know?

She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.

This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.

You broke my nose.

I thought you were giving up that drug shit.

No, let's go to work.  Okay?

You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?

You sure you won't come with me?

Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.

Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.

What is it, Miss Vivian?

It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.

You'll like it fine.

Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.

No, I'm sorry, I don't.

Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.

You don't seem excited, my little muffin.

On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.

I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.

I fear I'll never see you again.

But how can you be sure?

This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.

Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.

Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?

We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.

Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?

Why is that, do you think?

Hello.

-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --

Inigo -- there's more than thirty --

Has it been fifteen minutes?

A book?

Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --

I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!

Who gets Humperdinck?

What? What?

Now I think you ought to go to sleep.

As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.

I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.

-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it

She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.

Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.

Your guess is as good as mine --

Why? You can't even lift one.

No.

No --

-- anything you want --

What? What?

We're really in a terrible rush.

Sorry.

You don't know any way you'll trust me?

We'll wait until you're ready.

I admit it -- you are better than I am.

I must know.

Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.

He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.

He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!

Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.

Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.

Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.

You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --

What's so funny?

Yeah, an hour.

Think it'll work?

Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?

But sir, I'm not condem ...

I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?

Here, don't panic.

According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.

What was I saying?

What do you mean?

Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.

Will you get a hold on yourself.

Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?

Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.

You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.

You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.

There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?

Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.

How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?

Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.

I never should have listened to you.

Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!

Don't help me.

"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...

Vat about it?

Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.

Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?

You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...

Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.

Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...

Always.

Min Bialystock.

Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.

Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.

Finder's keepers.

Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.

Good.  Yes.  Thursday.

Like clockwork.

Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.

By the sacred memory...

Wagner...

And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.

Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.

Okay.

We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.

Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?

Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?

Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?

No.

No.

No! Of all...

What do you mean?

Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...

She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.

Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?

You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?

With a little checking, I could get to believe you.

You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?

Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.

No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.

It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.

Please!

Yes.

What's the matter?

He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?

You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.

That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.

No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.

Let's go see Al Chambers.

Our Deputy sleeps.

I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...

I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.

We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.

We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.

What?

Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.

We could laze around here a while longer.

I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.

Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?

Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?

And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?

You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.

How can you even think a thing like that!

Hey, we can leave together can't we?

Dirty night.

Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 

There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.

Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.

You should... mind it.

I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?

Phoenix?

Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.

Alright, Miss... 

You slept here all night?

There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...

No, m'am.

Is there?

Oh?

We have a problem.

You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?

Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!

Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...

I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!

They thought she'd be coming to me.

Just before she died she came to--

Did you wish to see someone?

Then you knew of the inheritance?

What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?

I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.

How do you do.

Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.

Take me down there.

What is it now?

Your father?

The child!

There's no child here.

But you were in on it -- you worked for him.

All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.

What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.

Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?

But why? She's the best friend I've got.

Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.

Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.

Let me go! Let me go!

Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!

Charming. More delightful people crippled.

Meaning what?

And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?

You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.

Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.

Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.

Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?

That's the one.

Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.

Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.

Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.

It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.

Oh, is that what caused it?

A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?

Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.

Shall we unpack it?

To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.

Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?

Could you?

A place you've never been.

Dysfunctional --

Why?

I know, Mother.

I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.

You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.

Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!

You better quit that.

Rose, you must know who the fellow is.

You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.

Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?

I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.

Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.

I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?

He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.

Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.

Yeah, I know.

Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?

Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?

Uhhh, gahdam stuff!

What'd you say, Brother?

I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?

This is my place and you can't have it.

Wow! Brrrother!

She's putting the titty back.

Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.

Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?

Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.

A baby... and she isn't even married.

What sad news? Did her cancer come back?

All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?

I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.

I am ahead of you.

Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.

Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.

Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.

Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.

What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?

But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.

Boys? You say to me boys?

I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.

It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?

She already told you, she doesn't know.

Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.

Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!

I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?

Is anything wrong?

Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?

I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.

I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.

Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!

Yes, I am.

Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.

Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...

Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.

Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.

Um-m, well...

She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.

Yes, dear, what is it?

Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.

Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.

Yes, thank you, Doctor.

Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.

We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.

Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?

What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?

I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.

No more dentists, no more dentists...

Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.

I... I can explain...

What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.

How much?

Have I ever steered you wrong?

Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?

Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...

We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.

You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...

Hey now... what the fuck... ?

You shouldn't litter.

Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.

This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!

What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?

All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?

Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?

That's them trying to kill us.

Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!

That's sick.

What's the plan?

I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle

You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?

Birth control's important.

You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...

Where we going?

Okay.  But, what changed our mind?

You live like a pig.

Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.

Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.

You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?

You could start over again with cash like that.

He tried to kill us.

Our resignations.

It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.

He went to pick up lunch.

Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.

Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!

Couldn't have said it better myself.

Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.

Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.

"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.

What... ?  Not you too?

That's not true.

If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?

What the hell's his problem?

The gang's all here!

You see that?

You always did have style.

At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.

You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.

There's still good in him.

Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.

But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.

Your eyesight will return in time.

Yes, my Master.

Wouldn't miss it.

You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.

Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?

Vader's on that ship.

I don't know.  Fly casual.

I thought she was with you.

I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!

Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.

Shall we try and go around?

What's going on?

Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.

It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.

Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.

In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.

Here we go again.

We're coming!

But he asks the impossible. I need more men.

All wings report in.

There it is!

Tell me.

I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.

No, you don't. You've always been strong.

You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.

You cannot hide forever, Luke.

Master Yoda, you can't die.

How many languages do you speak?

Do you have any tattoos Brad.

You!

Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.

Janet.

Yes Brad.

Uh huh.

Oh Janet

Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.

Oh....Say something.

Well I want to leave.

Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...

Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.

Hello.

Good God.

Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?

Promise you won't tell Brad.

"Sweet Transvestite"

Was all I had to say

And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.

Are you - giving a party?

What's funny?

Some people are very shy by nature.

I would say you're very shy by nature.

After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.

I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?

D'you really wanna call?

You sure?

...T-thank you.

I always knew you was pretty.

How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?

Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.

I thought it might be cute.

I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.

Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!

...Paulie. Stop now!

Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.

Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.

He got lucky.

Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.

Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?

Still to be held in Philadelphia?

Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.

...That's an old one.

Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!

Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.

Few minutes?

Seven minutes!

Cost ya a buck.

That's ten bucks.

You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --

It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.

The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.

Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.

Don't hit the face! Not the face!!

Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.

Ya sure?

Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.

Mr. Balboa --

Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?

Makes your breath like garbage.

That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.

What was I gonna say?

...Who'd ya fight?

'Bout an hour ago.

Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...

Whatta' those?

How 'bout a glass of water?

Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.

Don't you care what the people will say?

Whatta you get outta this?

God bless ya, Rock.

Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?

...What kinda dog is this again?

Yo, Paulie.

She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.

I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.

...Maybe I better forget it.

Why?

If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?

Ain't sure, what's the story?

So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?

I'll tear his head off.

We don't serve formula. Snookums.

No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.

My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...

My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.

Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.

Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.

So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?

He's a riot.

What was <u>that</u>?

Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.

You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?

Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?

Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.

What's with the dip?

You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.

A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.

Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?

I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.

Maroon?  Whaddaya want?

So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.

Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.

Say, who's this guy laughin'?

Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?

You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!

You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.

That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.

By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.

Quarrel sir! no, sir.

Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.

Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?

But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.

Out--

Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

'Tis he.

My poverty, but not my will consents.

Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.

Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

It strains me past the compass of my wits.

Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.

O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.

There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.

How well my comfort is revived by this.

Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.

I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!

O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?

I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

I have.

Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!

I take thee at thy word.

How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.

So thrive my soul--

By the hour of nine.

Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

Why, then is my pump well flowered.

Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?

Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.

Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.

Nurse.

This is important.

I don't know.

What is?

So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?

About time!

I'm a patriate.

It's quite satifactory.

Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?

Where's the case?

That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.

Do you have the material?

What do you mean?

If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.

I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.

This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!

What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.

Whoever hired us.

So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.

Sent it where?

So what do we do?

Then I guess we're set.

What are you doing?

American.

Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.

Yeah.

So this is what, a test?

You should watch what you eat.

Same thing, isn't it?

What's the difference?

Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.

I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?

I needed to know.

How did you know?

The question still remains: what do we do now?

Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.

You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.

The Irish representative?

I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.

How could you have done that?

Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.

The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.

Gaelic.

I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.

I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!

I've got one condition.

Shhh!

How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!

I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...

How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!

I can't do that.

You think he's bluffing?

We're not?  How do you figure that?

It's too late...

Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!

You don't expect us to believe that do you?

Could it have been in the Mercedes?

Nothing's wrong.

Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.

What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...

Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.

How are we going to do all this?

I don't know, Booth.

Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?

I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.

Be more specific.  A month, a week...

I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?

What?

Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.

Maybe.  Maybe not.

Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.

Don't you have to be here?

Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.

Shopping here?

Do you know...34 C?  32 C?

A lot of men come in here?

Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.

You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.

What are you saying?

Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?

Whatever...

No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!

Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.

I'll settle for a third of that.

I'm not asking.

I didn't know you were coming.

I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.

Are you hungry?

This whole place?

Don't you want it?

You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?

Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.

You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?

That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.

Yeah, that's right.

I'm busy at the moment.

I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?

I'd like to pay you for that laptop.

You get massage from Chinese girl before?

Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.

You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.

I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.

I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.

That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.

I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.

Goddamn you got a small ass.

Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.

Not Yu.  You!

Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?

What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?

You're not very good at this, are you?

Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.

It's a long story.

I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?

She's getting undressed.

No.  It's not right.

Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.

Pick it up!

I wouldn't do that!!!

Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.

I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.

I'm not used to having a partner.

Well we're not friends.

I think we should stop talking.

That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?

You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.

Red Dragon.

What is Mac out?

I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.

They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.

First class.

I could use a little vacation.

You move well.

Are you okay?

Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.

You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.

A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.

The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.

Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?

I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.

When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?

You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.

Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.

You like it?

You want more?

This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.

Like that.

No, please, I don't --

Oh no.

No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...

Oh my god. Griffin.

It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.

Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?

You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!

Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.

Yeah. So why you look do down?

How much they want?

Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?

Yo, Johnson...

Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

I would like one of my people to help.

What is he up to now?

At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?

You don't understand this guy.

Ahh.

What do you expect me to say to this?

Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.

How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?

God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.

"Sink the putt."

Look, he's running after her.

Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...

If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.

Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.

No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...

Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.

Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...

I am just such a reporter.  And you are?

Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?

Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --

You're going to be very disappointed.

That's fair.

Everest.  Is that right?

Really?

I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.

My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.

No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.

It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.

No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"

No.

I'll have the same.

Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?

Where did you disappear to?

It's fun!  It's high.

Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?

To who?  Are you asking me?

You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?

Used?

I'm listening.

So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?

Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.

There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.

Good morning to you, too.  You look good.

But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!

But I'm weird.

He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.

A harmless joke.

"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.

Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --

Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --

I'll wait.

I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?

Walter.

Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...

I told you.  Nothing --

Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.

You should write something about this.

"Sleepless in Seattle"?

And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.

Plus he fell in love with a temp.

Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?

Did you talk to him?

You don't know who she was, Annie --

Go home for the weekend.

I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.

I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --

I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?

I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.

I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --

Hi.

It's you.

Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.

What are you going to do, Sam?

Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?

Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.

Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.

It's Y. O. H.

Dad --

What?!

"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?

Somewhere in the middle.

She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!

You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --

If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?

In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.

I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.

Great.

This is a good letter, Dad.

Have you seen my wallet?

What's wrong with Annie?

What if I couldn't get to you?

Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.

What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?

Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.

Do you like baseball?

You're kidding --

I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --

Oh.

Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?

Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?

How goes it?

He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.

Are you sick, Mama?

To the mine?

Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.

He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.

But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen

Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!

What's the matter?

A fighter, huh?

Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.

What were they saying? About you? In there?

Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.

Let them take it!

It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.

NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.

You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!

I waited up till midnight.

Where are you going?

Ramón -- you can't.

Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...

Aw, cut it out, Ruth.

Go on. Spill it.

No ...

But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.

You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.

Are you Australian?

What?

What?

Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.

They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.

Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.

How?

Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.

Oh, he's a keeper all right.

I can't.

Fuck you.

Why don't you call the cops?

Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.

Is that how you play?

What do you want from me, Colette?

So you're just attracted to me, is that it?

You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.

I'm kind of busy.

He knows where I work.

What's wrong, Danny?

Really, I don't want to.

What is it?

You're good, princess. I'll give you that.

Colette, go.

Oh shit

Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?

How the hell did we get this detail?

Nice day

Fuuuuuck

Jimmy, where do you find these people?

Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?

Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?

What does J.F.K. stand for?

Danny?

But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.

Okay

Why?

What the hell is that?

But...I've seen you.

This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?

Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?

I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.

Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.

I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.

What?

Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.

What? Is it bad?

Murder.  Beautiful.

Danny?

This the guy?

Turns out he's connected.

What'd you do, piss your pants?

Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?

Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?

Tom, let's spend the night here.

First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?

You thinking what I'm thinking?

She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.

Report.

They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.

A private, sir?

Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.

If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.

So, that's Ryan.

He ain't half-bad, I guess.

Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.

I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.

You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?

But you could have gotten killed and I...

It seemed appropriate.

Over three-hundred.

If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.

Good luck, Captain.

That only leaves three.

Beasley's dead.

Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?

Makes you feel small, doesn't it?

No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.

How about...?

HOLD YOUR FIRE!

Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?

And how do you bluff yourself?

What do you think?

Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?

There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.

Captain, can I ask you a question?

Jesus Christ, he's a natural!

Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.

Up.  We're moving out.

You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.

Maybe Caen.

I wonder if his cabin is still available?

Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.

The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?

Yes, Private.

Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.

You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.

Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...

I usually like surprises.

How do you do it?

Pardon me?

No, no he's not.

Speak with my lawyer.

Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?

Thanks, I like yours too.

You're tough, J-man.

Then what's love?

Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.

Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.

Yes.

Alright.

I don't feel anything.

I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.

I told him to be himself.

Lloyd, it's us.

You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.

I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.

One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.

And I want to turn the home over to the state.

That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.

Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.

I didn't think anyone would get it.

What are you doing?

Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!

Morning honey.

Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.

You should be.

You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.

You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.

Lloyd?

Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.

It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.

Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.

If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.

Dad, are you okay in there?

What happened to you?

I swear to god.

Honey, it's not what you think.

Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.

If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?

Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?

So you're monumentally busy?

I'll go.

Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?

Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?

Keymaster?

So it's an honor?

He does this every year?

It's just you and your dad, right?

I only have something like sixteen weeks.

You have to meet Bess.

It's okay, everybody does that.

Let's get outta here.  You want to?

Why didn't you tell me?

Okay, what did we just decide?

It sounded like you did.

She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.

What do you want?

Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.

I'm fine.

Good to know.

Yeah.

YEAH!

No my brother, you have to go buy your own.

The truck?

Thanks Lloyd.

Seriously, Lloyd.

No, really.

I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?

She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.

Oh boy.

Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?

This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.

It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?

I was gonna...

Give me my firebird keys!

I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.

The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.

Luck.

Should I stay?

All right, okay, let's talk.

That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.

You want these people.

If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?

So I'm responsible for the weather?

I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.

Like this?

I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.

Oskar, good of you to come.

Thank you.

It kind of looks that way.

He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -

Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?

Jews, yeah.  Investors.

What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?

I got to go, I'll see you.

You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.

I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?

Four hundred, four fifty -

Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.

I'll talk to you later.

Have you checked the...

He's broken his pattern.

I would say we are now officially baffled.

Outside.

Don't do that. Hang up...call...

Yes.

Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.

"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?

Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.

What do you want from me, Cotton?

I get my revenge and make some fast cash.

No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.

Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.

Do I know you? You look familiar.

Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?

Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.

I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.

Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son.

But youll never get away with it.

How do you put up with this Greek shit?

I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?

It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.

Lemme take you home.

Go on, untie him.

He seemed harmless.

Youre the one who got away.

A twist ending if you will.

..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...

I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...

And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.

A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?

Ssshh! What was that?

Jesus Christ!

As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.

Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.

Who are you?

No, wait...

I'm sorry.

It's good to see you involved.

Lucas and his Romper Room stage.

He tried to kill her first.

"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...

It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.

A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.

The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...

The young girl is slashed again.

I've been waiting for you, baby.

It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...

Do you want to die?

You ass.

Do you work for her now?

If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.

There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.

Well what number are you trying to reach?

I think you got the wrong number, buddy.

What do you mean?

I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!

I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --

So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?

That's Sidney Prescott's mother.

Who?

Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.

Four? There are five.

What do you know about trilogies?

Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.

Excuse me?

I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.

Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?

I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.

Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.

What about me?

Gale, your engine's still running.

Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.

I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.

Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.

You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!

God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!

God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!

You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.

Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.

Possibly.

We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.

I know!

I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.

Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.

All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.

It is in my script.

What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.

No.

Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?

If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!

You're dead!

Laura I think I just killed somebody.

Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?

Nope.

That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.

Billy? What the...

My dad's in the other room.

Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.

You know that's not true.

Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.

Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.

Who did you call?

It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!

Jesus... fuck, that hurt.

Hello?

You bitch -- where the fuck are you?

So why did you dial it again?

Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?

Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.

The first one was, but the rest sucked.

Why? You wanna ask me out?

Listen, asshole...

Is this some kind of a joke?

I'm two seconds from calling the police.

I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.

Where are you?

I wanna play a game.

What's his name?

Now for the real question.

Productive. So they're closing down the school?

I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.

Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.

Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?

Evening, ma'am.

People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.

Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.

Does mom know?

Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?

Did you reach my Dad?

I don't know. I guess.

Drive by patrol.

She staying with you?

Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.

They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.

Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.

Where is she?

Where is she?

Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.

If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.

The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.

I want to talk to you.

And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.

Many times.

Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.

You're evil.

Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.

Can you see me right now?

Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.

Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.

...so call if you need me.

Stu was with me last night.

I thought Blockbuster fired you.

Stop. Right there.

Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.

That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.

For about two seconds.

Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."

Jesus, this place is packed.

There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."

His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.

Remember, there's safety in numbers.

Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.

Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.

Or a man's mentality.

Tell your mom I said thanks.

Thanks, Tatum.

Practice ran late. I'm on my way.

But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?

Who?

No way.

Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.

You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.

How's that?

He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.

It's none of my business anymore.

Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.

They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.

What time is it?

It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.

I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.

I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.

Not here.

I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?

There's a bucket here.

You think it was poison?

The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.

He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.

This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.

I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.

All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.

You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"

Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.

He's preaching.

Seven Terraces of Purgation.

You're sure your men didn't move this?

You tell me.  I'm new in town.

How was it?

The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.

Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.

We don't know for sure...

It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.

I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.

This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.

The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.

We could use about fifty more men here.

No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.

You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?

You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.

What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?

Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.

You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?

What is it?

Slut.

Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.

You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.

I don't know why I asked you to come.

I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.

Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.

It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...

They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!

What you saw wasn't Lucy.

Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?

You ain't goin'...

You got any more orders, Captain?

I didn't give any order to fire!

I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.

I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.

Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?

If there's anything I can do, sir...

And what makes you think he's in this territory?

You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...

Martin! Ride me as far as the well!

Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...

Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...

And maybe you lie...

My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...

Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.

Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...

Well, come on!

You want us to fire a shot if...

And you think we got a chance to find her?

Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...

He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...

Why?

Hey! What's the idea...?

You ask her!

Think she means for us to follow?

Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.

Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.

I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...

I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.

I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...

Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...

Where?

Ellen, move aside...

Stop that!

I'll do it myself.

What are you doing?

Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.

She was old.

Maybe an animal.

Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?

Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?

You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.

For God's sake, what happened to me?

Ellen Straub.

Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.

Mrs. Straub!

It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...

You did not like the speech?

NedI knowI know

Ah

I know your face. Are you an actor?

Wait!  Will you desist!

Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.

We have no Juliet!

Are you writing?

Words, words, wordsonce, I had the giftI could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstonesfor sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnerybut now

A woman of property?

So now you are free to love

When?

The theatres are all closed by the plague!

But nothing is happening.

Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.

What happened to Sam?

No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?

Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.

The show must  you know

Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.

Wonderful, wonderful.

Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.

I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.

And--?

But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.

Fifty shillings.  Pounds.

"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"

"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"

As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.

Who are you, master?

Oh my lady, my love!

Can you love a fool?

Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.

I am.

I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.

You would not leave me?

Oh, Will!

In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.

I know how to fight!

You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.

"thou need'st not to be gone."

An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?

But all ends well.

I have spoken with your father.

My lady VIOLA.

I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.

And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.

Yes, sir.

I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.

She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?

Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!

How do I offend, my lord?

Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!

There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?

An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?

You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!

What's his name?

Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.

You think so?

He's still here.

When are you going to let the police know?

Now what else? DAVID I don't know.

So who's going to do it?

You know what. Who's going to do it.

I can't do it.

I don't know.

Don't you worry about that.

Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --

You looking for me?

I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.

Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.

No, can't think of anything else that matters.

Just one thing.

And you like it?

When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?

God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.

For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.

No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.

So we'll meet him, then?

What's he doing here?

Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.

You know we're right.

I don't see the point in that.

He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.

Aren't you going to answer it?

No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.

Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.

Are you all right?

It makes us feel a whole lot better.

No, nothing, sorry.

We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.

Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.

Why do you want a room here?

It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.

I've never seen a dead body before.

Two hundred.

I thought you'd gone to work.

We already know. All about it.

So let's go.

Yes.

What guy that died?

Do you think you could answer that?

And he's a patient of yours?

October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.

I suppose so.

Both, sir.

I thought you were in a good mood.

What're you talking about, George?

That kid... the hairdresser.

Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.

We cannot go into this later.

Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?

What're you looking for?

Thanks a lot.

What?

I'll be back in a while.

-- to be put in that kind of position...

What're you doing later?

I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.

-- Anyway.

I know.

That headboard.

You going to answer it?

Want me to?

You know what I'm talking about.

No. You know too many sick ladies.

How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...

Did you hear me?

Yeah, it is.

I am not!

After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.

You promised you'd do the show.

I'm sure.

Where do you want to do this?

You don't seem very sure.

Sit down.

-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...

He still having parties?

-- yeah.

-- but you never were much of a tit man --

-- ass and legs --

What's wrong?

-- It's Malone's.

I don't know... Jackie?

Yeah?...

-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...

Call me!

I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.

Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.

Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.

When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.

Will we live together?

But in the same house, you know, one house.

George.

They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.

George.

Whether or not I'm going.

Egypt.

No, but I think they might.

But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!

A friend dropped me off.

What business meeting?

Now, Jackie --

You did fuck him, didn't you?

Said what!

But what?

-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.

All night.

I wanna hear about it.

I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!

Why, why do you think that is?

Have a drink.

What about Jackie?



All right, who're you with? Jill?

I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.

Who were you talking to?

Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.

Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.

It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...

You're lying about one thing, Lester.

Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?

Shut the door, shut the door!

Here.

Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?

-- you phony asshole --

Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?

That's right.

I am? I mean why?

Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.

You're really a love -- you sure?

We don't think marriage is important.

He does?

I would say so, yes.

-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?

Johnny!

I'm terribly sorry.

Good for you.

You're kidding.

-- I'll get in the back --

What did you say your name was, sweetheart?

-- yes, Jill.

Are you married?

No of course not.

Everything okay, son?

Call me Les.

Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.

Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?

You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?

Chocolate.

Why don't you want to talk about it?

Yes.

I don't know.

Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.

Yeah.

Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.

It's so pretty.

Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?

Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?

If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.

Mommy...

What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?

But eh what was the matter with him?

Tony.

What sort of injury did he have?

It's okay, really.

That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.

She eh... interferes.

I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.

Good evening.  Forest Service.

Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?

No, we don't mind.

It's good to see you.

Hi, babe.

Sure is.

Somebody did that to him.

Yes...

Of course I am.

Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?

Stay away from me,

Stay... stay away!

Stay away from me.

Wendy...

Very nice to meet you.

been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.

The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are

Well, obviously some people can be

This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.

Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.

Lowe's car-?

Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.

You all right, Marty?

Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.

You got a pilot's license, Marty?

You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.

What is it?

Well... was it a prescription?

Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.

Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.

After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.

I saw what I saw.

No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.

I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.

Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-

You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!

Really.

But how?

Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?

What you do?

Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.

For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.

What? 

Oh, girls.

Look at that.  Get a gander.

Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?

Two days.  An hour or so.

Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?

Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?

What is it, Mary?

Jackpot!  Two buckets

MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE

DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE

Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.

Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.

Hopeless I

Is there any syrup?

You have to help me

No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?

Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?

Oh my Lord!

What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?

What?

The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?

But what do they want?  Where are we going?

I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING

BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME

I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.

Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.

Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.

As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.

This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.

Oh, I don't know... Satan?

I got it.

Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.

Sometimes it's not enough!

Really catching on.

Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.

Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.

Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.

I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?

So I don't shop.

I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.

And if I don't?

Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.

Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.

I've got to go.

Vince knows you're here.

I can't go with you.

Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.

What're you doing?

Don't you have a concert to go to?

We're looking for Mike.

I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.

I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.

Get her!

But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.

Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?

Yes, Mary Patrick?

We did it!  We actually sang a chord!

I'd rather sing than do anything!

Mary Clarence -- you're alive!

Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?

Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.

Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?

Why did you move the body, Doctor?

Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.

You need to sleep.

No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.

Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?

Wallowing quite literally in blood.

Do you have these persons' wills?

Damn... damn... damn...

The Widow Windsor.

Where are we going?

Out there.  What do you see?

If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.

What is it?

We should not go much further in this murk.

What good is this?

There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.

There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.

What can we do?

What now?

How are you?

Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?

You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?

I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.

What are you on about?

What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?

You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.

Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.

Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.

Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.

Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.

The church.

Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...

What... what are you doing?

Go home.

You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.

There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.

Thank ye.

We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.

He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.

Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.

Yeah.

Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.

Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.

You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.

Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.

You know what, by God?

Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 

He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.

You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.

Leave.

All right, y'all gonna go with me?

Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.

Stop it, Doyle!

Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.

Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.

You believe in the Bible?

I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.

How come?

Are you well?

I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.

I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.

I like the way you talk.

Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?

You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.

What do you mean?

I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.

You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.

That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.

Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.

I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.

Yeah.

I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.

Yeah, I guess.

Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.

Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.

Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?

How come Karl won't eat here with us?

I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.

Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.

Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.

Huh?

I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.

Yes ma'am, I reckon.

I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.

You walk fast, don't you?

I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.

That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.

I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.

Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?

Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?

Do they know about you?

You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?

Well, okay. I got you some.

I don't think I've ever seen you before.

What brings you back?

Naw, I ain't.

I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.

I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.

Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?

He just got out of the state hospital.

Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.

Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?

Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?

His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--

Will that be cash or charge?

Jesus, what happened to you?

Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."

It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.

Hey, Auggie. How's it going?

Do you think I could buy some before you leave?

It's yours?

I didn't know you took pictures.

I'd like to see your pictures some day.

It's kind of overwhelming.

What do you mean?

Slow down, huh?

I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.

I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.

So what did he say when he called?

Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?

It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.

Two, right?

You usually get two.

Anything good?

I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?

What do you mean?

No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?

You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.

A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.

Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.

Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.

It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.

Jesus Christ. This is all I need.

So you're just going to give up and go home?

You don't take anything seriously, do you?

I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.

Seventeen.

Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.

What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.

So I can get my job back.

It'll never be finished.

A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.

I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.

Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?

And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?

No thank you.

Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.

I figured he had a right to know.

Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.

No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.

Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.

It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.

Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?

I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.

It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.

I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.

Well?

I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.

Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.

I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.

Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.

Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.

That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.

Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.

Mostly what.

The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.

Here and there. Around.

I didn't expect to see you again.

That's it. Just the two rooms.

I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?

Eight-thirty.

I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.

I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?

Appreciation for what?

You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?

The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.

Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?

Celebrate? What for?

Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?

It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.

So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.

You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?

So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?

Well?

Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.

We came here to deliver some clean laundry.

I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?

How do you want that cooked?

Lettuce and tomato?

Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...

$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.

So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.

But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.

And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.

Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.

So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?

Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.

Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.

He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.

I can just feel my spirits soar.

You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.

They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.

Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...

Well, what then, sergeant?

So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.

And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?

As my wife testified, we were considering it.

Yes.  Initially.

My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?

Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.

How long you have this detail?

I did.  Boy.

This tastes horrible, hmmn?

He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.

If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.

See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.

Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...

You wouldn't even see it move.

Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...

And what's that?

I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.

Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.

Does it now?

Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.

No spare.

Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?

One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.

What else could it be?

For certain, no.

Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?

The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...

Okay, doll.

It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.  This is from me to you, doll.

You're welcome.

Upsy-daisy.

- so the one-legged jockey said - 

He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.

What are you giving me with the rabbit?

But suppose it doesn't?

Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!

Nellie told us about it.

No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.

It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.

Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.

DAPHNE?

Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.

Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...

Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.

But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?

Good night, Daphne.

How can we?  We're broke.

So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?

What message?  What motorboat?

Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.

You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?

And where's he going to be?

What are you doing with my flowers?

Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?

I'll say there is!

Jerry - there's another problem.

Oh.

I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.

Sugar?

Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?

Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.

Did you hear that?

She sings, too.

Oh - Sugar!

It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.

I'm not crowding you, am I?

Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.

So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.

We better have a drink first.

I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -

But there's one thing I envy you for.

Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.

I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.

Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?

No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.

Oh, come on - you can do better than that.

I always did.

What's wrong with us?

Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?

Just a moment, miss -  May I?

You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.

Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me

My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.

But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -

You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!

Daphne...

You're leading again.

Don't I know you two from somewhere?

Anything today?

Because I got some plans -

Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.

The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?

We got it second-hand.

We got time off for good behavior.

On the Baltimore and Ohio.

Me?

Rough?

You can't trust those guys.

Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.

Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.

Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?

Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.

What makes you so sure?

Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

Well, I guess I'd better go -

I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.

Look at all that silverware.

It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.

Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.

See?  Nothing.

Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -

Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.

Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -

Anything this time?

You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 

I think you're on the right track.

Really?

That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.

That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.

Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.

A merger?  How long will you be gone?

You're not?

Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?

You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -

You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!

You're wasting the taxpayers' money.

Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.

Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?

Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.

You shave with your spats on?

I dont think I can go through with this.

Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--

God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.

You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.

If Ed ever found out....

Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.

Say something. Please.

Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.

I thought you said you were crap.

Ill just check into a hotel.

It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.

Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.

Hey, you!

Its called character. God, youre predictable.

You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?

Its the past. Its nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.

You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked.

The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?

Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?

What does your gut say?

How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?

What is?

Not the way youre thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.

How did you know that was me?

Yes.

I love that youre asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?

Dont stop asking questions, okay?

And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?

What?

Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!

I just hate seeing you so stuck.

Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?

Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.

I should go.

Nice speech. I thought it was touching... and funny.

Like fifteen.

You want me to let him in?

So whyd you let him go?

Shes drunk. -er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?

Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?

I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.

You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!

Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 

What about Sounder?

Well, how did you like the class, David?

Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.

And so you did your job, right?

How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?

If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.

Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?

That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?

Into the clouds and behind the mountains.

And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!

But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!

Mister, can you visit anybody here?

What's in there, David!?

David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!

Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!

Who's winning, Mama?

Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!

I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.

Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.

I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.

Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?

We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.

You ready to eat?

Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.

I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.

Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.

Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!

What?

Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'

OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-

Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.

Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?

I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!

No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!

WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!

Hey Cartman.

You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.

Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...

We're not gonna have pie and punch!

I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.

Mph rm rmph!!

Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!

What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.

What was that word, young man!?

What's going on, Chef?

Hello there, children!!

Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?

Viva la Resistance.

Donkey raping shit eater.

Ber dada!

What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!

Mph rmph rm!

Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.

Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!

What's that?

YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!

Dude, we don't have watches.

OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!

Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!

Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!

Wow, a lot of people showed up.

I thought you had something planned.

Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.

I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!

SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!

The F word?!

Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?

Hello, Conan!

Fight the power!

You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!

Saddam, would you let me do my job please!

Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.

Who's my cream puff?

You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.

Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!

You know I do.

Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.

<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>

I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!

No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.

Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.

Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?

NAZIS!!

Stan, I never cared for Gregory.

Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!

I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.

Uh, yes I am.  And you are?

Oh, thank you.

No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.

And what are they doing now, Mac?

All too well, captain.

No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?

Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.

It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!

Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!

Barnes?

Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.

This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!

Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.

Look at this...Jesus.

Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.

We're going to die.

Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.

I'm sure you'll be all right.

Do you want some advice?

Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.

What's that?

I'm in the bridge.

He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.

Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!

Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?

I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.

Thank you.

So I've been told.

What is happening around here!!!

Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.

How is it looking, Mac?

Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?

Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.

Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.

Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.

Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.

I hate fuckin' opera.

She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.

Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.

What's on your mind, Miles?

Who are you? Who sent you here?

Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.

She thinks someone's trying to kill you.

I do what I gotta do to survive.

What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.

I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.

No...

Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.

The whole world thinks you're underground.

Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!

He's the guy Buzz.

I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.

Son?

My poor baby!

He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.

Junior.

So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.

Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.

Leave him alone!

Is Mr. Fazeli in please?

Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.

What does he do?

Can I ask you something personal?

So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?

What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.

I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.

You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.

What are you going to do about your brother?

I can't tell you, Theo.

I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.

You told Junior that we did it.

My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?

Lane's closed big fellah, league night.

How big is this spacecraft?

I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.

Norman!

They told me about sixty hours.

It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.

Don't do it!

Norman, please!  Don't!

Come with me.  The team's already waiting.

Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.

A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.

Then why am I here?

What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?

Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?

See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.

Maybe older --

The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.

Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.

Picked up something?  What is it?

Don't get hysterical, Norman.

Harry's missing.

But sir --

Edmunds?

Can you open that panel?

Yes, sir.

Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...

Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.

We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.

Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.

You don't know that.

Who is that?  Where's that coming from?

Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.

She wired this system.

I'd also like it noted --

What <u>about</u> a crowbar?

What's wrong?

Resetting the sub.

To the spacecraft.  To investigate.

Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.

Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.

You said something to him, didn't you?

Beth --

Don't do this.

Forget the sub.

You, me and Harry?

Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.

None of this was here before.

Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.

I don't know.

I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...

And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.

It's for motion sickness.

A synthetic opium analogue.

Riordan?

Three to six hours.

What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?

You ever given an injection before.

How do you feel about snakes?

Are you manifesting them?

Someone did.

You're lying --

Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.

It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.

You hear that?

He doesn't wait for an answer.

Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...

Is it coming from our own computer?

Don't be defensive.

C'mon.

This answers one of our questions.

Not a clue.

No.  I didn't say that.

What is that?  That noise?

What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?

These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.

Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?

You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.

Did I kill her?

Fine.

Missed.

You know how to work this thing?

Well, press something!

Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.

It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?

Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...

Meaning it didn't land in the water.

Well, if it's a discharge --

What'd you say?

Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.

He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.

Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.

Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.

What was it?

Well, we'll see...

The Empire must have gotten here first.

No, not anymore.

How much do you think she's talking about?

I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.

I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.

I assure you my intentions weren't bad.

It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!

We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?

When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?

Are you all right?

Are you sure you don't need it?

I can't do it.  I'll get hit.

What about the princess?

I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...

I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.

As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.

All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.

We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.

Who's the pilot?

I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.

No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!

I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.

Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.

You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?

Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?

What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...

Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.

See Threepio... do you copy?

You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?

Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...

Whad'ya talkin  about ?

I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.

Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...

Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?

Did you read her mind ?

Don't think about it... go on instinct.

Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?

You always told me you couldn't do human...

Johnny, this is Zander.

Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?

It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.

Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?

Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.

Well, whad'ya know...

She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.

WHERE IS IT ?

So ?

Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.

I thought you were going to help Carl.

Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...

I love you, Carmen.

I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?

He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...

Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.

Do you mean it ?

What's wrong with you ?

Johnny...! I thought you were dead !

Take care, wilya Johnny ?

AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !

Alright, take her out, Ibanez.

Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !

Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.

This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!

Uh, look, Diz...

What's your malfunction, Rico ?

What ?

It stinks, you goin.

Way to go, amigo !

Mr. Rasczak.

I'm eighteen. It's my decision.

A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?

Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?

Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !

Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.

Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?

I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.

You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?

Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.

Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !

Is that your signature, Rico ?

Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?

What do you think you're doing ?

Don't be a hero...

Mister Rasczak ?

Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?

Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?

Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.

Who is...'V'ger'...?

Where is Lt. Ilia?

Disclose the information.

Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?

A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?

It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.

I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.

Yes.

You saved the ship.

Granted.

If our Executive Officer has no objections...?

Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.

I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.

That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.

Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.

They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.

Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.

Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!

'Commander' Decker?

Time to impact...?

Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!

Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.

Viewer ahead.

We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...

The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...

Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.

I still contain fragments of my human half.

It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.

We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.

Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?

What answers?

Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...

V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...

There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...

You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?

Why aren't you on board?

Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...

Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.

Dock control reports ready, sir.

Evening, Annie.

You're doing a <u>Play</u>...

...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.

I want to rent this one.

The people in New Hampshire.

Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.

So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.

Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.

Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?

But why the dalmation?

You get what you pay for.

That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.

That: in an act of...

Of <u>mercy</u>...off...

Goodbye.

For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.

I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...

...such a pleasant sound.

Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...

They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?

I...I decided to give it another chhh...

What I need to <u>say</u>...

About <u>conflict</u>...

<u>How</u>...?

Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...

Uh huh.

Gonna' be good as new.

It's for your finger.

Hi.

Oh <u>okay</u>.

Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?

Why?

What've you got?

...yes.

Hi.

And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?

I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...

What are you going to do?

Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...

Drama Group?

I know em, I don't know what order they come in...

What courthouse?

Well, where do they hold court?

But, does it have to be an Old Mill?

<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.

I will.

Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.

How big is this horse?

Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.

Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...

...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...

How'd you like working with Richard Hill?

Mornin, sister.

The prices are going up.

How old are you?

Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.

She's a <u>waitress</u>.

Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...

Nobody.

I want you to hear this.

You have no right to...

Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...

You have to hide.

That's my...

I know that...

...I know...I know...

I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...

An artist of your caliber...

I know...

That's cor...

Did she throw up?

Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?

Kiss my ass.

What?

Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...

Why?

...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?

I have to talk to you.

...he's the producer of the movie.

Doug...

Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?

I'm looking for the writer.

Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...

I had a witness I would.

What?

That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...

I'm very sorry I...

Not now.

I...?

Grace...

Why?

Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...

Hi!

She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...

Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...

How was your flight?

Marty...

Eight hundred grand to show her tits...

I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.

The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...

I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...

Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...

On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.

I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...

We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?

Why?

Ben!  What's wrong?

Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...

I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?

How would you know sh...

I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.

But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.

That happens.  To families.

And don't tell her I told you.

I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...

I said...

He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!

She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!

I could help with the debate.

How many devilled eggs can you eat?

Annabelle...wake up honey...

I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...

I don't want to say goodbye.

Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.

Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.

You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.

No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.

You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.

I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.

What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --

No.  I think it's ugly.

You do NOT run out on your moth...

&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!

&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;

...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!

IS THAT YOU?

Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?

Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.

Rachel's job is she works.

Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.

ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!

Where Ben?

Ben where do you have to get to?

Okay.  These are good.

And when did that pass?

People beat it, don't they?  All the time.

Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...

Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.

It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...

I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...

Because you don't really seem here.

Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.

Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.

At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...

Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --

I'm afraid she's going to walk.

You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.

You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....

How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.

Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.

I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.

Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...

Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...

She hasn't mentioned this.

She's devastated.

I really look like shit.

He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.

Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?

Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...

Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...

It's just not the right time t...

That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...

You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...

And I'm going to win.

Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...

Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.

You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!

See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.

Why didn't I?

Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...

I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.

We have the kids this weekend, so...

You don't trust me to be alone with them.

Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...

Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?

Oh my God.  Are you serious?

She's not gonna die.

I told her I loved her.

'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'

Where you goin'?

Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.

Don't ever say that.

Out! Leave the table!

We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.

You know...Stanley...

No prob. I'm cool.

Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.

Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.

I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?

And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?

Really? How many?

But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?

Must've been hard being poor.

Consuelo. Are you crying?

You have a bay?

Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?

Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?

Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.

Why was he on Death Row?

So whaddya think?

It's all about who you know.

Well, I changed the ending a little.

So you don't want to hear my new ending?

Marcus...You'll write something better next time!

And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?

Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.

I dunno.

The same. Same as what?

Scooby?

Whaddya wanna talk about?

OK.

That's good.

Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...

Nigger.

Nigger, fuck me hard!!...

Hello?

Oh, that's too bad.

Anything I might know about?

That's too bad.

That's good. So then what do you do now?

Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.

Yeah. But not any more.

Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?

How'd you get it?

You a pervert?

What for?

Can I see what you have so far?

What is most important to you?

Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?

He's a very stubborn man sometimes...

What's that supposed to mean?

I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!

That's it!  Up ahead!

Go fuck yourself...

I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...

I suppose...you think I should thank you.

Well?

What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?

Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.

Good.

Agreed--let's move it.

My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!

Just what the hell is he talking about?

Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--

Possibly some coffee?

The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?

I have your word, Mister President?

Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.

Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.

Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?

What are you talking about, Major?

Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.

On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.

You've wasted enough of my time, fella.

Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.

Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.

Go back to sleep, baby.

I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?

Does the threat board show anything?

Well, Mister President.

General Schmuck?

May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???

What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?

Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?

No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.

I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.

Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.

That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.

I suppose they are, sir.

That about right?

I see.

I suppose we might catch them off their guard.

Where, sir?

Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.

Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.

Do you think they would cheat?

How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?

I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.

But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 

I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.

General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?

He says they've only shot down three planes.

Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.

We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.

Maximum ECM.

Then this is it.

War.

Check.

Just the missiles.

They can't touch us at this height.

Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?

Where'd they get you?

What does it look like?

No kidding.

Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.

That's what I said.

Are you saying our order don't make sense?

Fusing for ten thousand air burst.

Master safety.

Primary bomb is live.

What happened?

He's dead, all right.

No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."

Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?

I said that's the point!

There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.

We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?

There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?

Forget it.

At the bottom of mines?

In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.

It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.

We are?

Can I have some?

It was pretty bad, huh?

That was really great.

Responsibility, progress.

Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?

Hey!

No I quit.

A cloud.

Do you wanna go to the van?

Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.

Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.

Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.

No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.

Stuck with what guy?

No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.

A long, long, long...

Good.

Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.

Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.

No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.

I know, man.

Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?

Wait. Hey, man.

What she doin' in the van, man?

What?

She's dead?

Tim...

See, I wasn't making shit up, man.

Hey, come on, man! Limo!

You better! Yes!

It's safe, come on.

Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.

Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.

In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.

You make videos?

You could do it.

Come on. Inside.

A Porsche.

Yeah. So, what about you?

I'd like to.

Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.

I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.

Hi.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.

Uh-huh.

What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.

Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.

Tim, what are you talking about?

Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?

Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?

What? What'd you do?

No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.

Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.

The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.

Oh, it's very complicated, huh?

Please?

Yes, you asshole.

No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.

Yes, I stand for -

It got that close.

Jeff. Jeff.

Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.

So what do you wanna do?

My goal is to make art.

Come on.

I've run out of words.

You did, huh? Good for you.

You really suck, you know that?

Good, man.

Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.

Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?

Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.

Now?

Great.

For a while.

Yeah, well, that's what I do too.

I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?

Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.

Get off my roof!

I hope you're happy!

You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!

Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?

You do not want me to do your cover.

Oh they'd never let me do what I want.

Would I get paid?

Yeah?

Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.

Jesus, Jeff.

I'm moving.

Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.

"See what's around you listen to their lies"

Tim?

About where she went. I mean, what bar?

The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?

Yeah?

Your manager?

Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?

Fucking drunk, huh?

Hey, your gonna regret this.

Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.

I'm going out later.

I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.

Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!

Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!

And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.

Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!

Another sex dream?

Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.

...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --

Di, we're sorry.  We...

Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!

Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.

Positive.

Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --

No.

But, we have to make a smart plan!

Hi, Jack.

... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?

Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.

Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...

Oh... What are you working on?

Nope.  Sounds more like the first.

Madonna.

Shut up.

Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.

You want us to help you pick up?

Hello?

You got that big retarded girl down there?

Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.

...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...

All of you!

Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.

You shouldn't smoke so many of those.

They could kill you.

I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.

What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!

...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!

I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.

What the hell do you want?

You're going to stay, aren't you?

Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?

Sure, this'll go on all night.

Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?

Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?

The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.

Name dropper.

There's one called....Window... something with a window.

Who wants true? Who wants moving?

I was afraid of that.

Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.

If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.

Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.

Check.

Sorry.  It's your baby now.

It's just impossible.

Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.

And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.

I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.

Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.

Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.

Hello, Betty.

You bet.

Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.

All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?

Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.

That's what I want to talk to you about.

They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...

Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl

Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.

It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.

We've made a lot of pictures together.

Of course it is.

Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.

I want you to do this work.

Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -

It's getting kind of late --

I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.

Cut away from me?

Don't bend back like that.

To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.

You're really going to send it to De Mille?

What on earth, darling? It took you hours.

Where are my cigarettes?

Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.

No you didn't.  You took the car.

That's between you and yourself, Norma.

You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel

No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?

You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.

Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.

And she's turned you into a servant.

All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?

Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.

Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?

Haven't got a thing.

There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.

This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?

Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.

Madame is wanted on the telephone.

I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.

If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.

Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.

Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?

That's easy for you to say, Bianca.

Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.

Home?

Wait...don't leave me in here...

Don't leave me.

This is my favourite place in the city.

I'm sorry, I don't understand.

I used to work here summers when I was a kid.

There's one sure way to find out how you feel.

You're not afraid are you?

I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.

But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.

Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?

Before you go...

Oh no, not you again.

If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.

You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?

You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.

I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.

Yes.

I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!

I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.

I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.

I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.

Why didn't you tell me?

There isn't any.

Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.

Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.

Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?

The Danvers. And two of your little friends.

Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.

What's it like?

I was on Earth...

It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---

It's lovely. . .

Are you happy, Zaltar?

There is a way.

Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?

You're going to take me back?

Mr. Roebush?

Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?

Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.

You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...

And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?

Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?

That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?

Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.

And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.

Gee, I always loved porch swings.

No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.

Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---

Uh...excuse me, folks...

Mr. Kent! Superman was here!

Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?

You're the best, Lois.

Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .

A television set?

Sonofagun! Look at this here!

No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.

Gus?

The boss wants to see you.

Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!

But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?

But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?

Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...

What?

And do nothing. Just sit there.

And then shut down the pipe lines.

Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!

I told you it wasn't no jive.

Thanks.  Let's go

Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...

You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.

What terrific story?

Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.

Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...

If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!

How would you know?

Where's the light switch?

Mr. White, the next number, please?

By hand. Like the pioneers did.

85,000 dollars.

I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!

Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?

Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!

Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...

I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.

So?

Come on, let's give it a dry run.

Lois, what are you doing?

Uh. . .

Maybe I could try --

Where were you?

It's true. It's true.

I'm in love with you. How do you feel?

I'm listening.

I want to.

I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?

Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "

"They?"

You do?

Does Lois know about this yet?

Mush!  Mush!

I like trees.

Well done, Miss Teschmacher.

Genius!  --  Lex.

No, me, me, me. Thank you.

Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?

I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?

For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."

DELETE IN CUTTING

Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.

Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .

There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.

Who is this . . . Superman?

And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?

There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?

Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.

They make my eyes itch.

Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.

Any more like you back home, Clark?

No Paris?

Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.

Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .

This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.

. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.

He missed the door, Uncle Lex.

Boy, are you gonna get it.

What I need this for?

I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...

What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?

Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.

Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?

Superman. . .  But you're... dead!

But . . . how could you beat him?

You're a great architect, Albert.

You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.

I'll bet you have some good ideas.

Some people aren't the athletic type.

See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?

It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.

Big night coming up?

Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.

For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.

The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?

It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.

Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?

I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!

Shut up.

They stop for nothing.

No news is not good news. Y'know

Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?

I mean the other one!

My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!

Then -

How come you get all the good stories, Lois?

It's a ...baby.

All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.

I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton

....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -

Do as I say. Let go!

With my luck, now it'll rain.

Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.

It must feel great.

How much do you weigh?

And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?

Please...

I still don't get it.

What is this??!

Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?

The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.

Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.

I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?

Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.

She's in trouble?

What...does it turn to?

What happened?

What happened?

Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.

Case?

They just finished supper.

I'll be back around nine.

What do you mean 'outgrown it'?

I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.

So what brings you out tonight?

No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.

What time's he coming home?

Yes.

Good night, Billy.

I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?

...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.

Because I have to.

That's the way I thought of them sometimes.

Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.

It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.

That's what he said, is it?

He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.

It's for the school bazaar.

He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.

What happened to summer?

So do you like your new room?

Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.

Nicole?

Yes.

What about Doreen?

When?

Have they ever been busted?

Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?

That's not news, Zoe.

Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?

What for?

I can hear you breathing, Daddy.

I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?

Yes.

It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.

So you're just the thing we need.

If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.

Are you a reporter?

No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.

Yes.

My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.

Yes.

Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?

Why not?

There wasn't time?

What's so funny?

What's that?

Pretty slick, eh?

You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.

Are you sleeping?

What do you mean?

Will the police do anything to her?

That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.

Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.

Where are we running?  What am I missing here?

Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.

I still think he's responsible for the smear.

That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.

Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.

When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?

That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?

I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!

How is dear old J.J. by the way?

Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...

Does he have to be here in our hair?

Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --

Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.

May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?

If looks could kill, I'm dead...

And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.

Not being partial, are you?

Why are you trembling, dear...?

Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.

Match me, Sidney...

Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...

Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.

I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.

Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.

But it's too late.  I got him back the job...

What's this boy got that Susie likes?

What does that mean - integrity?

What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!

Are you listening?

Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...

J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.

Sidney, I told you -

I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -

Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!

What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.

Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?

Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?

You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?

And where was his wife?

Do you think you could do something, Sidney?

What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?

Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...

What would you think of me if -

Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.

Go home, Sally.  It's late...

Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?

You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!

Did you now?  On which bounce?

And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?

We stick in each others craw.

It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.

And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.

I didn't do anything!

But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?

I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...

Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.

I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.

Steve, I...

Do you know about the chip?

Do you have bandages?

My God.

No good.

Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?

Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.

You have to do what I say?!

It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".

That's great!  See, you're getting it.

You will.

The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.

I'll deal with the police.

No!

Easy money!

So she's pretty cool, huh?

No shit?

I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.

Yeah.  Drag, huh?

I love you.  I always will.

I know!

This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?

Can it be destroyed?

My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.

I must be destroyed.

... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --

On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?

Where do you stand on all this?

I'm very sorry.

David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.

I guess so, sir.

What the hell are they doing?

What?

Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.

Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.

Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.

This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.

And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.

I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.

Your mother, too.

Steve.

Of course.

But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.

I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?

I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?

I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?

I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...

Then you are wrong.

have no idea what ordinary people thought.

No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.

Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.

I'm sorry.

Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.

I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.

Okay, so what is it?

Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.

I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.

Major.

Yes, you remember.

I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.

The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.

And ask him about his private life.

Oh! The evening before, I see...

Was looking at Furtwängler like that?

Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?

Conscientious, determined, dogged.

Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...

Aren't I worth waiting for?

I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.

Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.

Can you handle it?

You can't to that...

I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.

Not lately.  Did you check messages?

You must have a girlfriend.

Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.

You volunteered?

About what?

Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?

Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...

Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?

Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.

I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.

Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.

That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?

What are you doing?

Sarah.

I didn't build the fucking thing.

Surrounded by living tissue.

Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.

Same shit.

That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--

My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.

You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.

I could fight you on this.

Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.

Do you know what to do?

Alright... okay...

The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...

There's got to be a flashlight.

I'll wait.

You're the one who started running.

There goes a thousand dollars.

Nice.

Goodnight.

I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.

Do you mind if I sit?

Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.

What are you doing... ?

They did the same to him as they did to you.

All I mean is... someone like you...

What are you <u>doing</u> here?

It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...

He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...

What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!

Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...

One brother, one sister.

Julliard, yeah.

No.

Hey there, Nickie.

Happy Birthday, man.

They gave me a free jacket at the door.

Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.

Really?

Call that number.

It's a profound life experience.

Who?

Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?

No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!

Where's Christine?  The waitress.

How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.

I need your car, Elizabeth.

V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...

We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...

Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.

Sorry to keep you waiting.

Get rid of them.

They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.

Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.

Where?

Where'd you pick up your checks?

Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.

Didn't I give you two?

Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?

All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.

There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.

Your ex-wife.

"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.

Hey... !

Anything wrong... ?

Attractive...

How concerned should I be?

Just what I told you.

Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?

Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.

Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...

And what kind of sleeper?

Couldn't get the last ones.  You?

So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?

Luke, can I talk to you?

And those are Luke's and mine.

It's not going to hold your weight.

He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.

So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?

Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?

Was sure she'd be in here.

Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.

I, I just can't...

Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.

You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.

All the carvings.

Nell!  What's wrong?

All right...

And then what happened?

Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...

Why would we want to do that, Nell?

Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.

Well this is a cozy breakfast.

Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?

That's where she hanged herself.

And what you're wearing, that's great, too.

What do you do?

Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.

How could he have left without his keys?

Why?

Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.

Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --

Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.

Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.

Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?

It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.

Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.

I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.

The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.

We think someone is here.

How'd you like to kill someone for me?

Same as last time -- the rest after.

Fuck you.

Man knows what he likes.

Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?

I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.

You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.

These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.

He don't have a concealed weapons permit.

Five years, I think.  Long time.

Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.

Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.

Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.

What are we standing on?

Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.

Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.

... Reminds me of Jennifer.

Perhaps it was the smoke.

You weren't disappointed in her, then.

When did you get in?

The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?

What's that, like a P.O. box.

-- Your employer?

I see.

So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.

Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.

Oh, I was gonna say ...

What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.

From pursuing your chosen profession.

Overnight.  What about just now?

You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?

Minor officials bother you, don't they?

I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.

Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.

But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.

Yeah, I guess you are.

So what's your beef, pal?

It was you.  Downtown.

In which case I'll just do what I usually do.

Don't you work with Ian?

What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?

How much.

Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.

Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?

She's nice lookin'.

I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.

Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.

I don't get it.

You know her?

Where is he, then?

What kind of trouble are you in?

Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --

You must know Ian.

Ann--

Hello, Mr Crane.

I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.

Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.

It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.

...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?

You got the dough?!

...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...

...Was that a pass?

...You bring a check?

...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--

Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--

All right.

...Were you in the service, Ed?

...That's quite a wife you got there.

She's a rare one.

...Ed, I...

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

How much to they want, Dave?

Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--

That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.

*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*

Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.

Honey.

I don't know what's going on. I--

I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.

I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.

Will anyone else say they knew?

...I don't get it.

Yeah.

...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...

...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...

...Huh?

That was something. I'm Ed Crane.

Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?

...You sure, Eddie?

Frank.

You don't got a headache?

I don't understand.

Birdy... I didn't mean to--

...I'm Crane.

Hello!

Doesn't bother me.

His eyes are open.

My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!

Battery's dead.  Shit.

Fifteen... what's next?

An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.

In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.

Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.

Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!

Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!

Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?

Lieutenant!  It's me.

What happened?!

All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.

What's that doing here?

This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.

Like the claw.

Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.

None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.

You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.

Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.

Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?

I don't want to go this way.

Not that big.

It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.

They've got something.

Mbwun.

These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!

Is Dr. Frock safe!

John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --

That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.

My God.  Then it was an animal.

I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.

Where would we find it?

It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.

Dr. Green...

But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --

You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.

What happened?

You smell that?

He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.

I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.

Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?

What happened down there?

I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.

How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?

But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?

In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.

People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.

There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.

Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?

We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.

I have a map.

Why not?

You take Japanese.

Lauren, right?

Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.

It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?

See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.

Marlon--

I think it's got something to do with my dad.

Stay where you are!

Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.

I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.

I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--

Let's go now.

It's hard to go places, isn't it?

Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!

So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?

You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.

--Darling--

It looks so small.

Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.

Is there any way around?

How's it going, Truman?

I think you better tell us.

Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?

Do they know?

I'm looking for him.

Have you examined them?

How's that?

Do I know you?

You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?

You know my work?

What?

-- You saw this experiment?

You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.

Had you.

I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.

Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.

They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.

They were the ones that put us together.

I wake you?

Go home, Mulder. It's late.

Mulder -- what are you doing?

What did you find?

Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.

-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.

How was it contracted?

Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?

And where are they going with it?

We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --

Where'd they go?

I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.

I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --

I have. I did. It's done.

What? What happened?

Scully...

Scully --

-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.

What are you doing?

Mr. Mulder.

The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.

We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.

Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.

You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.

Sing a song of sixpence...

Did we go sailing?

"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."

He hates me.

It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.

I do it all the time!

I'd be there for him.

You're sure?  Any more nightmares?

Don't bring it home in this.

...a pocketful of rye.

What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?

Agent Novak?

Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?

It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."

Evil.

Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.

Oh no... No you don't.

Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?

I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.

She changed the codes.

Instead of going into his mind...

When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.

I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?

I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.

You're looking well.

How's the patient.

So?

Here he is.

After three years she remembers what the guy drove?

We proceed assuming she is.

I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?

Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.

Thank you.

No.

Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.

Dr. Winkel? Who is he?

Why?

I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?

Seemed like a good idea.

Well, I didn't learn that from him.

Let's go away.

Wer ist da?

What happened to your hand?

He liked to laugh.

Are you going, too?

Harry.

Of course I didn't tell Calloway.

Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.

He works in a military hospital.

That's what we want to find out.

Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.

Yes.

Where?

You a friend of Lime's?

Been here long?

You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.

Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.

"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.

Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.

Listen, Callaghan.

Do you see what that means?

...in the morning.

This is where he vanished.

It wouldn't work.

A girl of spirit.

Win what?

Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.

Do you know his number?

They wouldn't know me.

...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?

Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.

Hello, Harry.

Listen...

What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?

Unwise, Holly...

What do you want me to do?

Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?

...were of you.

Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.

...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.

Already gone.

Coffin?

Excuse me!

Did you know Mr. Lime well?

Happened...Yes happened right down there.

Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?

...give evidence.

I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.

That's all you meant?

Should I make it all fact?

...Mr. Martins?

Excuse me.

I'm Daffy.

Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.

Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?

Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.

Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.

She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.

He tried to borrow money from us.

We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.

Hi.

Have you told someone?

So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.

What, do you like it here?

Do we have to listen to this shit?

Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.

Yeah, but not on the letters.

Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.

You will.

Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?

Which is what?

Why no silencer?

Is he a Nazi?

I'm coming to your room tonight.

Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?

Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.

They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....

It looks a little like a swastika.

With you there's a tragic dimension.

V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?

And belief follows?

Fuck that.

No, I think you shouldn't.

Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?

Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...

Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]

I didn't realize you cared.

Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?

Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.

An investment banking house.

Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.

But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.

Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.

I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?

They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?

Let's just say I've done due diligence.

Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...

Why would Nadelman lie?

Give me a reason not to.

Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?

It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?

I thought you hated Torah.

You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.

I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.

So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?

Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.

Lina Moebius. And you are...?

Balint?

Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?

We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?

What about chicken?

Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...

The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?

That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.

Oh, what is this shit?

Not too fast.

What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.

Are you an artist?

Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.

How did you know they were Jews?

SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...

Who's this?

Leary?

Howard Stern.

Do you think I...

May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....

The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?

You're going to live here permanently?

Does he know?

I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?

You're leaving?

Johana, am I boring you?

My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.

What's happened??

No!

I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...

Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.

The Italian, I presume?

I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.

And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.

The Mamma's there too.

How do you know that?

Five minutes and fifty seconds.

How did it happen?

Roberto?  How long?

Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?

Santini will do that for 25 dollars!

It isn't lit yet.

Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?

I dove 315 feet!

... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?

Your mother?

Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.

Why?  Are they what's most important?

Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!

A drink to warm up?

Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?

No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.

No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?

Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.

Well, then, talk to me some more.

Then, tell me a story.

Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.

You'll try again tomorrow?

What?

What's wrong?

You want to lie down for a while?

This is the hotel San Domenico?

You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.

Does that have a hidden meaning?

If there was a problem, they could do something right?

... And those?

It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.

Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?

Wait!  Professor...?

Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.

I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.

It was a trap. I'm back at square one.

Looks like I got a plane to catch.

Please. Will you help me?

So. Do you have a name?

Mr. Jefferson Carver?

Client notes. Sorry.  What can I do for you?

Your mother? Oh. Whoops.

Oy vey, I'm stuffed.

So, now what?

What!?

I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.

We do!

So don't show a picture.

Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...

Happy Hanukkah Tikva.

Anything else?

But we're not open on Sundays.

You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...

What's wrong with him?

It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.

Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.

I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?

I wasn't too over the top?

You okay?

Sure, I like my leopards

What's left of him.

What did they say before the bad card came up?

I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.

Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.

You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.

It's about the leopard.

Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.

You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?

That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.

Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.

Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.

He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.

Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?

Wait 

That's why it just mauls and tears at them.

What are you getting at?

Chief, don't you understand what this means?

That's a fact, isn't it?

Get it out of here!

Makes no difference. Get him out!

That's easy. Me.

Makes no difference.  Get him out.

You look swell in that threealarm number --

Suppose I slip them a few bucks  for the funeral expenses.

I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.

What did he have to do - look at the body?

Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors!

Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me 

I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --

Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --

It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.

All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?

Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?

I wont comment on the time but youll understand if I dont tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 

Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But Ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why Im here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.

I will of course do my best to hang onto it.

No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.

The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.

Who is Friedman?

Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.

You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.

Mr Lombard...

Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?

Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?

Is there anything to understand?

What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?

What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?

Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.

What do you suggest?

Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?

Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?

Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.

Get a pen and dont ask any questions.

Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?

Then find another way.

...Im Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thats who I am. Do you get what Im fucking saying, Mr Lombard?

Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.

Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.

Weve still got the Italian...

What sort of puppy are you looking for?

So, what are you looking for?

How much of a hurry are you in?

Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian!

Where are the kids?

Where is it?

You sure you passed on my message?

Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?

So you havent seen the film, then?

Ive got work tonight, Jane.

Piss off!

Whatever, you come recommended. We...

I presume you checked your sons apartment...

So he could have decided to go on a trip...

We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.

Where is Friedman?

Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...

Its wet. Will this do?

Is this some kind of mugging? Because...

In my jacket. Left inside pocket.

You thought wrong. I havent seen Leon for months.

Is she on the phone?

No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?

The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?

He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...

Los Angeles is 100 miles away.

What about which girlfriend?

Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...

Quest-ce que tu veux?

Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.

We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.

Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?

Gluck.

Youre the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see whats left of him...

Why did you kill Friedman?

Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.

Are they still operative?

Mossad?

What do you think?

Very funny. Can I go on now?

Why, are you not ready to die for your king?

Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.

Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...

I also need someone who can read and write.

Who do they think I am?!

Jeanne, stop it!

What's going on?!

Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.

All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.

The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.

So... even you don't believe in me anymore...

To be killed in battle?

I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...

Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?

And?

Yes, but...

No, I... I held it up to...

Yes, maybe... I don't remember...

W-w-what are you doing?!

Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?

Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?

Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?

How old are you?

Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...

The voice was in your cell?

What did it tell you?

Please... may I have it back...

I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!

Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...

20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.

... and what... what did he say?

I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...

Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?

My captains have sworn their support.

You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?

It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.

Wait, wait...

Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?

Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.

You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.

Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!

Who told you to wear men's clothes?

You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...

Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?

Did your voice tell you to jump?

How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?

Stop it!  What are you doing?

But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!

Yeah...

La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!

You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...

Who gave you that horse?

How many did he give you?

What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?

I don't know... I thought...

I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...

Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!

That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?

God asked you to do something?

You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"

Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?

No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?

You think you are ready now?

But you already confessed this morning...

My father's.

So... everything sounds... wonderful?

Then... why are you here so often?

I don't want to wait for his call.

Hello.

I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.

Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.

Must feel better this side of the wall.

Funny time to say this.

Henryk's in there.

Can you help us?

Boys, boys...

They bombed us, we're off the air.

You know what we do? We use psychology.

But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!

I know.

Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?

I can look after myself!

What's that mean, no employment certificate?

Very appropriate.

No one thought they'd hold out so long.

Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.

Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.

No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.

I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?

Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.

Why didn't you come to me?

Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.

Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.

What's your work?

What's happening?

What about you?

Szpilman.

Careful! Watch his hand.

I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.

What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?

No, it was a table.

Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?

Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.

She looks tired.

They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?

You'd have to organise it up here.

And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.

Has Ada ever spoken to you?

No, words. You have never heard words?

No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.

You have to wash them.

Everyone has to practice.

What?

What on?

I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.

Which way are the rooms?

It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.

I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.

Twist!  When did you get back in town?

I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.

You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?

Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.

Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.

We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.

No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.

I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.

Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?

No signs of trouble?

You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.

Henry.

He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.

The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.

What's the problem?

Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.

Look at that.  He's got four apes with him.

How ya doin'?

Raise 300.

Raise 1,000.

I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.

A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.

Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.

My end was only one.

Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.

It isn't any better.

Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.

What time you get off work here?

You got a back door to this place?

Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?

All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.

Hooker!

Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...

Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?

You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.

If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.

You're dreamin', kid.

You should always look to the back too, kid.

You really picked a winner, kid.

You stayin' in or not?

What happened to your face?

A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.

You want a drink or something?

Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.

Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.

Will you wait until the chump is played?

On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.

Do ya know him or don't ya?

He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.

Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.

Why not?

I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.

Cheer up, darling.

He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.

How are you?

I can't help it.  You don't know.....

Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.

I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!

Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?

You took that money from Julia's hand.

Then what are you hiding?

Aren't you Nick Charles?

How did you ever remember me?

That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!

Come on in.

She... she fell over backwards.

Hello, Dorothy. 

I know -- I know --

Poor Dad, does that still bother you?

Did you kill her?

Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.

Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?

Ask him.  I don't know.

This gun yours?

So would I.

What about the suicide?

Trail him!  Trail who?

"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?

When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?

He telephoned me today.

I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.

About three.

You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?

You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?

Where were you?

Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!

I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.

I'll get some.

I know.

What are you going to do?

We're just having a little drink.

Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?

Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?

But what if you need more money?

Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?

She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.

But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.

Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.

I tell you -- he didn't do it.

Perfectly absurd.

All right - you didn't.

By the way, how is your father's side?

How many drinks have you had?

What hit me?

Who's that?

I'd like to see you work.

She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?

On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!

I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.

Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".

He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.

The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.

This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.

You mean, he might be hiding there?

You bet I wouldn't.

Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?

Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.

What things made you so sure?

Mimi!

Why are you saying it?

Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?

You worked here?

That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.

What's in the other direction?

...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.

Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.

You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?

Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.

Ready?

I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.

Not much of a pass.

The US Army:  Always an adventure.

Where'd they go?

You're the one with all the ideas.

Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.

You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.

Get off him.

Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.

We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...

That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.

Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.

Thanks for taking care of this for me.

At-at-at-at-at.

I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.

They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.

I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.

Now this is war.

Third.  What you're going to do with your third.

Steady it out!

What?

You can't tell anybody about this.

What!?

It's a mine, isn't it?

You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!

There's a way.

My leg is falling asleep.

How's this going to work?

You're going to be fine.

Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.

They're doing more than slapping.

Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.

But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.

Get up and dig.

It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.

What the hell took so long.

What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?

What if he's not?

And you; you've got it all together.

Epps?

Sorry.

I pick that way.

You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.

We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.

...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.

Damn it.  We lost the horses.

It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.

Epps.

This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...

I'm thinking about taking a trip.

Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?

He's not slowing.

Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?

Some good ones.

People are suffering.

How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.

You get it yet?

That's in two days.

At-at-at-at-at.

It's...it's...I don't know what it is.

We're going to get court martialed, you know that.

Yeah!  Yeah!

I thought we were dead.

Epps...

Think we can make it?

Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.

Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.

Think the Iraqi's killed them all?

When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?

Stress category.

Drug evasion with assorted perversions

HUMMMM.....

What's this?  Why did you change it?

What did you get?

Now?

They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.

What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?

If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....

Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.

Are you all right?

no...no, no.

But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.

There goes another of your disciples.

What's going on....what are you doing?

We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...

Not very encouraging.

I've got it!  Astounding!

I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 

Why did you have LUH come here?

I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.

Which way?

We've lost SEN!

I don't know.

She's not there

...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...

f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-

Who the heck're you?

Where did you get this?

What was-? Why...?

Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?

There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.

Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...

Right.

Which one's which?

Fuck factor?

More metal... sharp edge...

Something round, two wires ...

What's wrong?

What... ?

Right.

Any word?

We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.

C4, plastic explosive.

Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.

What's the matter?

No... No more killing.

Who are you calling, sis?

You touch me again and--

Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.

Vice... Jesus.

Pooch, can you move it?

That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.

Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.

Reilly, Vice. I-

Make an appointment.

Vice cop on a homicide?

A what?

T.J., what're you doing?

So what're we looking for?

Nice to be here.

What?

You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.

Yes.

Yes.

M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.

still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.

With the compliments of Colet and Company!

<u>Niente!</u>

But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?

Good morning, Major.

No color, no sparkle--but dependable.

Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.

Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.

Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?

You're not safe anywhere nowadays.

You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.

Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.

You say I am a crook.

No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.

Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?

That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 

The pepper, too?

Right.

And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!

Éysée seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.

No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 

But, Lily--

Then you go to the left. There's a landing.

Then you go into the foyer.

Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.

Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?

One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 

Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--

But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.

And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?

Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.

But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?

No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.

Then you use the wrong lipstick--

Then riding together.

Then lunch in the Bois--

Then a little nap--

Marvelous.

Good night. 

Like that!

I'm crazy about you!

Then why do you want to go?

I wouldn't say anything--I would act.

It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?

Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.

But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?

Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?

Yes! And he would have a little more time for--

Right!

Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!

Then why did you do it?

Yes, I saw it--but--

Bottom, left, right. I have it.

I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.

Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.

Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.

What?

The partners want to know how it's going?

I told you you wanted to take this call.

I make my own luck.

Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?

You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?

Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?

I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?

Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.

You know somebody?

Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.

Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?

Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.

The fall alone would kill you.

HELP! HELP!!

Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.

Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?

Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.

So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.

It is that simple.

Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.

You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.

Jack, must you go?

You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.

Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --

Where to, Miss?

You're trembling.

Looks okay. I don't see anything.

Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!

You have to go for help.

Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.

Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.

Rose, get in the boat!

It would be a nice change from you.

When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.

So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.

Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?

Good afternoon--

You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.

A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.

Did you find it?

No-o!

I'm so sorry!

She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 

Nice lines--

Like her paint job?

You've got lipstick all over you.

Where have you been hiding?

Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.

Isn't she attractive?

Don't be a c-a-t.

Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.

You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--

I could see you were pining away--

Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?

Oh, putting on the swell, eh?

Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.

Nix, the law!

Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.

Thank you, sir. 

Hello, Jimmy. What's up?

On the drunk.

I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.

Three Jacks.

How's your mother feeling?

That goes two ways.

It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--

Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.

Hello, young fellow!

Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.

Don't get yourself all worked up--

Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?

I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.

O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.

Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.

Your wife knows that, don't she?

I'll say--how fast is this boat going?

Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.

Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.

Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.

Maybe he just travels in bad company.

Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--

You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.

It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.

I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.

Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?

Well, let's hear the poem--

Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!

When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?

Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.

Is that one of the Who's Who?

H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!

Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--

That's him! That's the sucker!!

The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.

Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 

You leave the kid alone.

He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?

I mean if you knew it were stolen.

Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.

I'm all right.

I was in his cabin--

So how's Tombstone treating you?

The man dealing faro.  Who is he?

Listen, I want to talk to you.

I want them spitting blood!

I'm retired.

I'm sorry.  If there was any other-

What's wrong, Doc?

Very instructive

So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?

Maybe I ought to go out there.

Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!

What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?

I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry.

Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?

You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.

A which?

Hell, I got lot's of friends.

I don't believe it.  He's clean!

Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!

No.

But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.

All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.

We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-

Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?

That was lovely!

See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.

What's wrong?

Always?

So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.

I have to go.

I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.

What can I get you?

Milt Joyce, owner-operator.

No, stay.  Please stay with me.

No, no, I don't want to keep you.

That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.

'Least you admit it.

So what about you Cowboys anyway?

I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!

Florentino!  He's getting away!

I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there?

Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.

Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?

Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.

You were right.  It's nothin' like I thought.  I almost wish...

For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.

Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.

We should get moving.

Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?

Her maiden name was Sullivan.

Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.

Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.

Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?

Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.

See what I mean about it getting Spooky?

Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.

Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.

Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.

My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.

Briefly.

...And what's that, my dear?

Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?

Tsi tien, Chien-penny.

Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.

Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?

Paris -

More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.

Gone fishing.

Wade, what the hell are you doing here?

I don't know if you'd call it a boat...

What do you want with the Harbor Master?

I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?

Can you arrange a meeting?

Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.

Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.

Do I have to do everything around here?

I hope you'll be gentle.

And what do you call this?

Why don't we just take these -

Is this - like - a normal day for you?

Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?

- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -

The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.

Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.

Sorry I'm late -

The Queen invited you to dinner -

How sweet.

The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.

Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.

Take the men. I can finish alone.

They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!

I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.

Please sir. Please -

What about ID's?

Oh, no.

I pay my own way.

What did your wife get her?

Why, you don't want us to bring him over?

Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?

I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?

Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.

It was nip and tuck.

Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.

Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?

I could swear I heard my son call me.

I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.

You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.

I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.

Man, act like this is your home.

It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window

Good morning.

I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.

Haven't the years been good to Hattie?

Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.

One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.

Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.

How is everybody?

How is he doing?

Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.

You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?

How many people do you all feed?

Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.

Is this your house?

Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.

I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.

What must I do?

We can't really bring another family in here with us.

When did you talk to Harry?

He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.

Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.

I'm sorry he got those birds.

Yeah!

Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?

Can I help pump the gas?

Woody!  Buzz!

Which one can I open first?

Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?

Say, isn't that mistletoe?

Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.

Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.

Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.

Right?  Buddy?

Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?

Spaceship.

I sure hope this isn't permanent.

Shhhhhhh!

Hold on, Woody!

Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!

No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!

It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!

Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!

Ohhh!  You sunk it!

Son of a building block, it's Woody!

I don't know!

Oh, no!

Aa-a-a-a-ah! 

Laser-envy.

Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...

Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?

Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?

No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!

If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?

Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!

I got it, Woody!

Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?

Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...

Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.

Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!

Reach for the sky!!

Somebody's poisoned the water hole...

I'm red this time.

Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.

Woody, what are you doing under the bed?

You'll put your clothes here.

I like plaits.

He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.

Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.

I want to go home.

That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.

Who's there?

You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?

Surely she is older?

'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '

I appreciate you coming in so early.

One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?

No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.

I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.

It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?

You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.

To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.

Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?

I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.

I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.

My Leica's gone.

Did you meet the President?

We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --

What if every country legalized at the same time?

Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?

Okay, young lady, that's it.

Do you work?

Private?

How are your grades?

Inhale the smoke and hold it.

You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --

Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.

No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?

That's a big word for a fisherman.

She knows Arnie Metzger.

You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.

Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?

What do you think it is?

I'll put this in the back.

David --

You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.

You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.

Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.

This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?

Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.

My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.

We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.

That's good coke.

You will help me with my other problem.

Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --

It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.

Somewhere safe.

It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.

Does this offer include my partner?

The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.

We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.

I want your money, I'll take your money.

Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?

What?

I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.

Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?

Who are these guys?

Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --

Did you tell him?

Well, I've not brought them.

Shut you mouth or you'll be next.

Twenty thousand.

All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.

Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.

Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.

Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.

Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.

What's your name?

Where's that?

Holding hands?

Yes.

Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.

So, what's he like?

I read it in Cosmopolitan.

Tommy, let's put the tape on.

One of Edinburgh's finest schools.

Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.

It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.

A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.

I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?

Screenwriter?

It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.

Eughh. Sounds horrible.

Cut it out.

Don't know. Maybe Thursday.

How much?

So?

But you don't have the money?

And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?

This had better be good.

It's fresh air.

How's it going with Gail?

Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.

Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'

A walk.

What do you see as your main strengths?

Homeless people?

Qual se tu?

We sought only your infinite wisdom.

With a starship!

Why? Why have you done this to my friend?

No, no, it's not possible.

Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.

Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!

What's Emergency Landing Plan B?

Can we have it quiet?

You caught me on my way to the shower.

Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.

What is it you seek?

Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.

Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.

Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?

Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.

Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.

Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.

I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.

I could use a shower.

There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.

He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.

Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.

Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.

Spock.

You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!

Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.

There's got to be a way out of this place.

There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.

I must have your starship.

No! No reply. Remain on course.

Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.

Spock...  What have you done to my friends?

No... I didn't.

About the ship...





No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.

Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?

I don't understand...

I don't get it.

Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?

Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.

Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...

Hi, Alan.

My dinner.

Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.

How's it going upstairs?

Did you say Group 7 access?

Beautiful!

Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.

They'll start to soon enough.

Yeah...?

No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.

This town's full o' live ones.

Meanwhile, he might find it.

It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.

Yes?

Alan!

How about over there...that empty memory?

Did we make it?

A User -- in our world?

Yeah, yeah -- that's great.

Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...

Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...

I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.

Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..

I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.

Do you know what he's talking about?

My quarters.

Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.

This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.

What is it?

We have to get off this beam!

I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.

Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.

I'm done.

Uh huh.  Right here in river city.

So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!

Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.

It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.

Helen's going to be pissed.

What's the plan?

Abu Kaleem Malik.

Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.

He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.

Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.

Is this national security stuff boring you?

What're you talking about?  We have that.

Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.

It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?

Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--

Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --

She's lying.

Now what?

--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--

He's got it.

This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.

Well, what's the point of waiting?

Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.

I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.

Hello, Harry.

How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?

Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.

That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?

Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?

I don't know.  I guess I needed something...

What?

My husband can't know about this.

So last night was pretty exciting, huh?

What were you doing there?

Sorry.  Trade secret.

Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?

Are you sure you weren't followed?

Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.

Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?

Worse than Cairo?							*

Tell me what happened?

Helen, I want you to be my wife.

Not yet.

You got that playing basketball?

Great movie. Action-packed!

If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.

No. Not particularly.  How come?

Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.

Burt Reynolds.

Like it?

What kinda music do you like?

How long have you worked here?

Do you get paid a lot?

You know when you sat behind me?

She OD'd, didn't she?

You mean she got a bad batch?

What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?

Who?

Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?

Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.

Where you goin', honey?

Was it him or you?

Do you want some wine, sweetheart?

Why Cancoon?

Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -

Yeah.

All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.

You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?

Where the fuck is that bitch?

Clarence?

Alabama, could you tell Clar -

Money problems?

How much of that letter was on the up and up?

You're really in love, aren't you?

Elliot what?

The zoo.

They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.

Clarence.

Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?

How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?

He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.

So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -

Leave the gorillas.

Where's everybody else?

Don't you?

Say it, goddamn it!

It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.

Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?

OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.

You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.

Where'd you go?

Why does he trust you?

Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?

What makes you think I would do that?

We do make a cute couple, don't we?

I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.

Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?

Could we try it now?

Where'd he come from?

He'll wear a wire?

Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -

Or a bit player -

And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.

He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.

He saw the wire.

Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.

What was I sayin'?

Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.

You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?

Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.

Naw man, that's some serious shit.

Preach on, Big D.

They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.

Put it in your pants.

Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?

Yes.

The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'

You said we weren't "real," Cole...

I understand.  There'd be no point.

To be determined by the proper authorities.

We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.

But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.

San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.

Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?

You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?

Why not?  Most people have some ID.

Do you know what year it is?

James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore?

I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?

"Never cry wolf!"

No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.

My notes.  Observations.  Clues.

A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.

I told you what I want.  Lock the door!

Just like that?  You were in prison?

You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?

The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?

James, you said he was hiding in the barn...

You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?

No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.

You... you couldn't have heard me.

I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.

I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.

You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.

I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.

Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?

Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?

"What about the germs?"  I say.  He goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?

That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.

County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.

Plan?  What are you talking about?

JOSE!

It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.

Uh, that message...me?

He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress.

Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.

You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!

Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?

You have him in restraints.

Tight?  My watch says 7:30.

I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?

Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.

Maybe I do.

We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?

Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.

Any parting words of wisdom?

I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.

Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.

You ain't nothing but an old fool.

Where to?

You want somethin'?

Nope.  Darrell.

Will he be back soon?

You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--

That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--

It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.

Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?

Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.

Just banged my head.  It was an accident.

To replace a God damn radiator hose!?

Two-hundred.

Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.

Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.

No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.

Taking a little trip?

That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.

How could I?  I was sleeping.

Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.

My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.

Do you have to call me that?

No, I've got it.

Accident.

It's nothing.  Really.

Where you coming from?

You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.

Nice place you got here.

Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.

My face tell you all that?

I think I can find my own way back to into town.

Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.

I'm guessing no.

Have you ever been there before?

Is it pretty?

Take me with you.

What are you talking about?

Shit!

Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?

I could if I had Jake's money.

Grace . . . Grace?

Why the hell didn't you do anything?

There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.

Let's do it here.

One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.

What?

You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?

Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.

Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.

I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?

John, throw me the keys.

It's . . . it's locked.

John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.

For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!

I'm a solid man.

Live there?

You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.

Hey!

I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.

Why would I kill her?

Hungry?

Now what can I do for you?

I'm not rambling.

You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.

You meant it.

Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.

No.

You love her, but you hate her?

Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?

This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.

Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?

A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.

Two-hundred dollars.

Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?

You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.

But you was going to fight for me.

I wasn't doing anything.

I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.

They're not very imaginative?

Mister!

That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.

Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.

Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?

Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.

His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.

Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.

Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.

I didn't do anything.

Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?

I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?

Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?

Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.

...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?

I wasn't doing anything.

Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.

Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?

That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.

Now, what's this?

Who the hell is this!?

Say, what happened to your hand?

Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?

Wait a second--

"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.

Talk?  About what?

Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.

You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.

If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.

I came for Grace.

You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.

You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.

Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?

Got any requests?

You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.

Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.

Will he be back soon?

So?

Hey.

What the hell happened to my car?

A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?

Yeah, but it was shot.

The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.

Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.

Look, Harlin.

And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?

Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.

Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.

I like that about me, beautiful.

What happens when you lose?

I didn't say it bothered me.

Nice place.

My face tell you all that?

I think I can find my own way back to into town.

Are there snakes out here?

You love him?

I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.

All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.

It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...

You mean the Shaman?

Yeah.

Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.

Where?

In <u>cash</u>?

It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.

I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.

I could if I had Jake's money.

Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?

Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?

I can't see it.

I don't know about that?

So, aren't you going to ask me?

When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.

Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.

Why's that?

<u>Jake</u>...

That's a nasty cut you got there.

Out of here.

I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.

How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.

Genuine Draft?

You never said anything.  About the drapes.

They look nice.

Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.

Proceed.

Is that the entire message?

I'm listening.

I don't know. It's been a while.

Okay.

Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?

...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?

At the church... You were following me weren't you?

What do you want?

Just give me a minute.

Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.

The guy might not have been carrying anything.

Quick.

Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.

I am. I'm helping him with the sale.

He's kind of a miracle.

Why'd you do that?

I'm going to work out.

What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?

You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.

I'm sleeping in my room.

Don't be scared.

What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.

Not really.

Now you're going to have to tell me more.

Well, go get it then.

You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?

If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?

You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.

Where'd you get the money, huh?

You told them cowboys you had it.

He said...

He didn't say nothin', huh?

...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?

What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.

Uh... a little, maybe.

Yeah?

An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?

They really got all that money, them whores?

Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.

I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.

The... Duck of Death.

But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...

I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.

A sign on him?

N-no, sir?

Yeah, I guess so.

About what?

She's passed on, Kid.

Been gone near three years now.

What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?

Get some sleep, Kid.

What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?

Better re-load it.

Yup.

You... gonna take... the money?

I... I... think I'm... shot.

Three ways?

Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 

Jesus.

No.

Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.

HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?

You want the Spencer, Bill? 

Who's he?

K-k-kill somebody?

What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?

Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.

You was right to change your mind, Kid.

Far enough.

Jesus.  You done this before?

His pistol must of jammed.

We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...

We done that stuff.

I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.

...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.

Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -

Don't give up on me now, Dean.

Come home, Dean.

Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.

This is not right.

It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.

He's alright.

It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.

I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.

We've met once or twice. Last time was in...

Three million?

What-are they speaking?

Keaton, I can't just -

The answer is no.

Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.

Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.

Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.

A little of both.

I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.

I'11 find him.

Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.

According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.

You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?

You know Ruby is in Attica?

There's nothing in there about Ruby.

I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.

Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.

I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.

Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.

I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.

Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'

I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?

I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ

No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.

Counselor, you're insulting me.

He was accused of jury tampering.

No -- we don't want this case in court.

It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...

Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.

... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...

You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?

Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.

Say it.

You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...

Thank you.  When Debby...

Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...

It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...

Well, many reasons, actually...

And what did your team do...

...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?

You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?

...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?

How is that?

Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.

Mr. Concannon...?

No further questions.

Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...

I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.

You sure you don't want me to stay on.

'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?

I read the hospital report on your client.

) I'm sorry ...?

The most respected ...

We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...

He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?

Who put my client in the hospital for life.

I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?

I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?

Is the Plaintiff ready?

Listen to me, fella...

Continental Casualty...

Mr. Galvin's...

We find that your subscription lapsed...

What Hotel are you staying at?

That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.

And it's over...?

Well, then what are you doing here?

What are you going to do?

Dr. Gruber.

Uh ...

John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.

Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.

We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?

I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?

... I understand ...

Thank you.

Who told you that?

A single hour.

I want to buy you a drink.

Well, well, well.  Huh?

...of the procedures...

Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...

Yes.

How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?

No.

The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.

Yes.

I didn't know where she was going to lead you.

Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.

He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.

Could I ask you a couple of questions?

My name is John Ferguson, and --

No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --

Just let me talk to you.

I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.

What do you want to know?

Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --

About three years.

Just dinner.

Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.

No? Then what?

As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?

No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!

Will you, Judy?

Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.

There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.

You want me to dress like her?

You don't even want to touch me.

Well?

That's what I had in mind.

I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?

Why?

I'm scared.

And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.

We're going up the tower.

Dead. He'd broken her neck.

Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?

Love me... keep me safe...

Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.

When?

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.

Oh! Yes. Hello.

I... suddenly felt such a fool.

I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.

No.

No, I Just thought I'd wander.

And no birds sing.

Have you been here before?

When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.

There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.

But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.

How do you know?

There's a name on the gravestone.

You've been there before. You've seen it.

Yes.

No... we're together...

Let me go! Let me go!!

Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.

No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --

And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!

Ow!!

Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?

I had to quit, Midge.

And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?

Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!

Have you had any dizzy spells this week?

It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.

Well?

Aren't you ever going to get married?

Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?

Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?

Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?

The poor thing....

Out!

Is she pretty?

Around.

Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.

She died.

No, that's not it. Nothing like it.

She'll be out in a moment.

The stripper's here.

Can't do what?

We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.

Name one.

Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...

Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.

About anybody but yourself. You never have.

If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.

Go home!

Don't even start.

What are you doing?

We have to call the ambulance.

Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!

Are you sure this was an accident?

Call the police. Okay, that's one option.

Stop it!

Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.

Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.

Wait. Wait a minute.

We can't do this.

Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?

We have to get going.

Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.

What?

Who? What are you talking about?

I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.

Don't snap at them!

They're screaming for Starbursts.

That's one idea.

Real times.

I won't do it.

If anything ever happens to me...

I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...

What are you talking about?

What is it?

She's not here.

I don't think so Boyd.

But not tonight.

Where do you look? What side of the neck?

He just had two.

No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.

Oh, Jesus...call the police.

Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!

OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.

Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.

What?

Regarding what?

Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.

I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?

This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.

If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?

Then what do they have?

I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.

Easy Micheal.

We're goosed! Goosed by God!

Can't we do it on the phone?

The wedding cake check?

Photographer?

Why did you forget the tent check?

What else have you forgot?

They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.

I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.

He just doesn't talk a lot.

He's a great chef.

Time out.

Not padded ones.

I need your help.

Do you love me?

That's sweet.

The chairs.

You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?

Yeah baby. Everything's great.

Yeah. Sure.

Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.

Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.

You killed a prostitute.

He kept saying he was protected.

Everything okay?

I'll take a ride.

I'm getting married...

Do you hear buzzing Fish?

If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...

I'm thinking about maybe making a move.

Yeah?

Good times.

Fucking desert.

I'll come to you tonight.

Give them to Refugio.

Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.

Take me there.

You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.

Come down here, you scamp.

What do you mean?

Never.

This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.

I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.

Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.

Sit down, I'm going to need your help.

They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...

Have you thought of what you want planted yet?

My God, what have you done to him!

What's the matter with you?

Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...

I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.

Kill him.

What do you know about me?

Yes. Why?

And ...your friend?

Is she coming back?

He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.

They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.

Yes -- very, very big!

Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?

I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.

Forgive me if I have offended you.

Have I slept long?

) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...

You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you.

I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.

What are they doing in Los Feliz?

Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar  you making it okay in there?

Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?

She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.

This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.

... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twentyfour citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.

There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.

Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?

That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?

What did you find out?

Enough to level an entire city block.

What did Cox pull him out early for?

Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.

How does he know who I am?

I haven't been working on anything.

Get that fucking thing away from me!

You need a maid.

It was you, wasn't it?

A little less than yesterday.

Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.

I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.

Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?

The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.

Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.

Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?

What does that mean?

Don't worry about it, all right?

Relax. I know what you meant.

Don't get out of the car.

What did you do to those people?

The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?

See something?

Nice work.

My guess is dead.

Where the hell are you going?

Then shoot him already.

Where's John?

You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!

What C-4...was Cox talking about?

Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?

To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.

It's the White House.

What about it?

No, this is great.

Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.

Whaddaya think?

Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.

Would you go to War to do that? 

And you're here <u>why</u>...?

Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.

Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.

Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...

...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?

Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.

What's going on?

Speak English will ya.

you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.

...Got a 100 on me, you...

That's great Dad.

What brings you out here...

...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...

Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.

...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...

I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...

You sure?

I don't know anything!

Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?

Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?

...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.

Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?

...rings a bell somewhere. So what?

Hi sport.

Nice club, Mr. Gekko...

Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.

I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.

The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.

Got him at an auction in Kentucky.

You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.

Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.

It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.

Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.

Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.

Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.

You got it, a great spender of other people's money.

I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.

If I could have anything... this would almost do.

So, how did your conference go with Gordon?

...isn't it perfect!

You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.

Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.

Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.

Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.

Hi.

Morning Buddy, you look happy.

Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.

Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.

I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?

So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?

I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.

You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.

Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!

And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.

We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.

Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!

He did?

Businessman?

Would you like a closer look?

And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir

And uh, your nicotine sir

Well?

Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.

Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college

When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you

Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?

Of course you will.

I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.

Did you?

Fireball?

What?

You're saying you willed these events to happen?

Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...

Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.

For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.

Who?

Who are you?

Tell me.  Please.

That's not...It's not like that.

For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...

No.

You must think I'm pathetic.

Mrs. Frank?

What's your name?

Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.

Wow.

I didn't sleep with him.

You're discussing me with your psychic?

Know what I think?

Nothing's happening.

I have to go.

Something was there.  You saw it.

And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.

I'm a terrible friend.

How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?

Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.

She's awake.

Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.

Claire?

To tell you the truth...I'm excited.

Wanna fool around?

Did she say that?

Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--

Hi.

It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.

Think I may have cracked it.

He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...

Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.

Get down!  He'll see.

He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.

It's a flare.

Maybe.  Point is...not me.

Dressed?

...like it never even happened...

There we go.

How do you know this?

How did you--

What?

Do I have everything?

What?

It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.

Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.

I may have seen her on campus.

I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...

It's too rough.

I don't like this, this...

I think she's starting to suspect something.

Your wife...

"You know..."

Stop...

The leaves...

Look for antiques...

Do you know it?

I don't believe you.

:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?

Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -

Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--

I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.

Rowan.

I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.

I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.

Who is this...?

You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.

Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.

Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?

The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.

I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!

--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.

The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!

Put - him - down!  His - his heart...

Harder...

Harder...

Yessss...

They like you ------- kids.

I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?

you're very --- different.

It's unbelievable that you can do that.

Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...

you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?

Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -

I'm serious.  You don't -

Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.

C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---

Something's wrong with you.

You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.

Go home, Stu  I'll call you.

Wow...

I'm getting --- left behind.

Rowan Mayfair.

I thought it was 'whistle while you work.

You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE

This must be one of the old keys -

It doesn't mention 'females only'

I lost the touch

Oh, about six years since I graduated

No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't

Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of

My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -

Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons

What's wrong?

What's wrong?

What is it?

But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...

Where are you going?

We've got nothing to talk about

ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot

Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?

What brings the rats out of the sewers?

It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?

As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?

Just put it in my room

You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?

Her husband left her

That's good

Dead?

Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand

Sugar?

Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...

I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.

The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.

Someday, I'll find out.

Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.

Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.

So far away? In Xenia?

Check this out.  Hurry!

Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.

Oh, how inappropriate is that!

I thought I loved her.

Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!

And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.

Get them together.

Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.

We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.

Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?

Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.

Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.

I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.

We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?

Sweetheart, what is it?

We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.

I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.

You guys are my parents.

Whatever helps you cope.

There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...

Finally, some gratitude.

I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?

THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.

I-I don't have the keys.

After graduation...maybe we could go away together?

Ted! Do something!

Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.

How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?

Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."

Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.

They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.

Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.

You're a peach.

That's a crappy thing to say.

So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.

Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.

A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.

In what sense?

I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.

Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.

You're amazing.

That's probably my office.

At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.

That has more to do with your proximity to me.

Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.

Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.

You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.

Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?

Well? Surprised?

Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.

Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?

But who would run the store?

I never figured you for a pimp.

What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?

You do like girls, don't you?

You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.

All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.

I told you you could do it.

The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.

So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.

Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?

I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.

I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--

In a hurry, are we?

You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.

I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.

About Suzie?

Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.

So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.

How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?

He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.

Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...

If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.

Maybe she used another name.

I've got that two o'clock in town.

That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?

We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.

This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.

You saw the news today?

I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...

I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?

I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.

No.

Why?

Suzie!  Did this man rape you?

I say something funny?

You are.

My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.

Kelly.  What is it?

He... Sam Lombardo?

You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...

Don't forget the car wash.

Look, he forgot.  I knew it.

So, where you off to now?

From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...

The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...

Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?

No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...

I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...

So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.

That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.

I'm running away.

But check this...

Forget it.

Can't you take that stupid thing off?

You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.

There's nothing for them to get.

You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.

Where is she?

No.

Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.

Get away from me.

Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.

I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?

What?

What's wrong?

I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?

Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.

Didn't you see her this morning?

Yes, aha.  A brass screw.

That's a lot of butler.

What was all that back there?

At least I tried something.

If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?

So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.

Can you fill me in here?

Know what this is?

No record of him.

What is that?

When we find him, he is mine.

There's only seventy-eight.

It was in your book.

Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!

Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.

You didn't tell us you had this on!

I could get used to this, looking down on people.

Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.

Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.

Your private train, sir.

Good work.  Really.

I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.

Really?  Must be a dangerous business.

Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.

These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.

The first.

Easy now.

Dr. Pemberton?

A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.

I beg your pardon?

Well?

We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.

The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.

You are very important, Willow.

Sir!  I have to talk to you.

Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.

You!  Are you the mother of that child?

We'll probably die here, Sorsha.

Who is that girl, anyway?

We're a tiny version of all that?

Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.

Don't make me angry, Peck.

You a woodcutter?

Smells like a battle.

I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!

Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?

Madmartigan, I need your help.

Did she ask about me?

She's in love.

Watch it!

Who are you!  Who are you!

Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!

Ouch!!

Tir Asleen.

I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!

We gotta follow them.

If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.

She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.

Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?

You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.

What are you going to do?

Don't let them hurt you.

Are you really ever coming back?

Have you got your gun on now?

So one of them got to him.

You're still convinced there's a link to the department?

When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.

You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.

I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.

I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?

You have no right to keep us here.

Whacking?

Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?

Where are you taking us now?

Who are they?

How long have I been here?

Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.

Your husband's?

I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.

You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.

But Stoltzfus said...

There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.

I want you to take this... to remember by.

I'm coming.

You know where he is.

Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?

I am not a child.

Never seen anything like that in all my years.

Is this where we're going?

Momma... are they angry with us.

I don't want to stay here.

Aunt Em!

Seventy --  Dorothy, please!

Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!

Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --

Yes.

Uhh -- yeah --

All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --

Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!

...have you come back?

Uhhhh -- yes...

Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!

Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!

Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!

Who did it? Now wait a minute.

Oh, please give me back my dog!

Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?

Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.

...Toto, too?

Are you ready now?

Oh --

Oh --

...her face is careworn.

Oh --

I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.

Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...

My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!

No.  Why only --  Oh --

Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!

Oh, my!

Because I'm still scared!

That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.

Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!

Oh, now I'll never get home!

Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.

Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.

Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.

Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!

Um-hmm.

Um-hmm.

But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.

Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.

...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.

I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!

-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.

Dear, whatever shall we do?

The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---

Dorothy next!

Would...would it do any good if I roared?

They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?

Where -- where do we go now?

From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.

What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 

There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.

No, her dog!

Quiet!

Hey, Dorothy!

Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!

What about us?

-- Ruined my exit!

You new?

Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.

He is an impostor.  Theres no Davidov at Miratom.

The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core!

Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.

What is it?

Is there another way?

Do you know what youre doing?

Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.

Elektra?  Running King Industries?  Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into.

Im well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.

Its a message.  He wants us to know hes back.

Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.

Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...

I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.

Who is it?

In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already.

A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.

God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.

Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?

I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.

I cant stay here.

I cant stay.

What the hell are you doing here?

You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.

Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?

Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?

I dont know what youre talking about!

Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.

So you killed your father.

One... last... screw?

You, of course. I need some information.

Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.

I thought you were the one in her business.

Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.

This is too big for even you.  Where is it?

Mother of God.

Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?

Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.

The parcels in the post.

What about our end?

We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.

No idea who's behind this?

Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.

And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?

Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?

The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.

This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?

Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.

I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.

Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?

The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.

No.  I just wanted you to --

Who?

She's with me.

Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.

Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?

They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.

Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --

His what?

Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?

Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.

This'd better not be what I think it is.

What?

No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.

Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.

Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.

So do I.  So do you.

How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .

Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --

No comment.

I'm terribly sorry.

Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.

Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --

What about you?

Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.

CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --

Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.

You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.

Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?

Not bad for a gimp.

Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?

You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.

He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.

How will you fix it?

So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.

But programmable. And expendable.

Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.

Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.

Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.

Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.

I was invited. What's your story?

I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?

What are you?

A beach named X? That I'd like to see.

I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.

So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?

You're what? What the hell have you been doing?

I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.

Where are we going?

Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?

We can't leave now. We have to do something.

They left. To a fortress in the mountains.

Aren't you afraid?

I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.

No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.

By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!

What are you doing?

The Peace conference...

Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.

Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...

My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.

I'll leave you two alone to talk.

Dude, what are you doing here?

I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.

Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?

Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.

We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?

Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.

You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.

You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.

I wish I could go.

Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--

What's wrong with him?

Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.

I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?

How long have you been in Alaska?

Anything else I can get you?

Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.

You should always work with a spotter.

He takes himself seriously.

Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?

I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...

You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?

What is it you intend to do to me?

Where are we going?

I've found her, Westchester Mall.

Don't you knock?

I'll find him.

I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.

You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?

I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...

And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?

Frederick Frankenstein?

Where did you get this cauliflower?

Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?

Carlson!

Love me oodles and oodles?

Surprised?

Miss me?

Goodbye, darling.

Darling!

Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?

That's a tough choice.

No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.

Well... we'll see.

That's 'Fronkonsteen.'

In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?

Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?

But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!

You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,

Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?

Are these your bags?

Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.

But what you were doing?

You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?

That's not bad.

You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.

More, do you hear me?

Throw the third switch!

I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.

Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.

Yes.

How's it going?

All right -- where is she?

Bring -- me -- the -- violin!

Thanks...for all your help.

How's everything?

Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.

MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!

Nice!  Nice little balance to it.

Did you have a pleasant trip?

Are you busy?

Inga!

Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!

Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.

Reputation.  Reputation!

It wasn't me.

It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'

Just passing through the night.

I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?

What?

Nor to Elizabeth.

And Elizabeth has hers.

Yes, I will.

Sweetheart.....Is this really you???

How long is it so far?



Another fifteen seconds to go.

1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir

Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?

Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.

Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?

What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?

How quickly can you move your artillery forward?

Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .

Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.

Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
